This means an organic farmer cant plant GMO seeds, an organic cow cant eat GMO alfalfa or corn, and an organic soup producer cant use any GMO ingredients. To meet the USDA organic regulations, farmers and processors must show they arent using GMOs and that they are protecting their products from contact with prohibited substances, such as GMOs, from farm to table.\nOrganic operations implement preventive practices based on site-specific risk factors, such as neighboring conventional farms or shared farm equipment or processing facilities. For example, some farmers plant their seeds early or late to avoid organic and GMO crops flowering at the same time (which can cause cross-pollination). Others harvest crops prior to flowering or sign cooperative agreements with neighboring farms to avoid planting GMO crops next to organic ones. Farmers also designate the edges of their land as a buffer zone where the land is managed organically, but the crops arent sold as organic. Any shared farm or processing equipment must be thoroughly cleaned to prevent unintended exposure to GMOs or prohibited substances.\nAll of these measures are documented in the organic farmers organic system plan. This written plan describes the substances and practices to be used, including physical barriers to prevent contact of organic crops with prohibited substances or the products of excluded methods such as GMOs. On-site inspections and records verify that farmers are following their organic system plan. Additionally, certifying agents conduct residue testing to determine if these preventive practices are adequate to avoid contact with substances such as prohibited pesticides, antibiotics, and GMOs.\nAny certified organic operation found to use prohibited substances or GMOs may face enforcement actions, including loss of certification and financial penalties. However, unlike many pesticides, there arent specific tolerance levels in the USDA organic regulations for GMOs. As such, National Organic Program policy states that trace amounts of GMOs dont automatically mean the farm is in violation of the USDA organic regulations. In these cases, the certifying agent will investigate how the inadvertent presence occurred and recommend how it can be better prevented in the future. For example, they may require a larger buffer zone or more thorough cleaning of a shared grain mill.\nUSDA supports all methods of agriculture production, including organic, conventional, and biotechnology. To help these different methods coexist better, USDA has convened an Advisory Committee on Biotechnology and 21st Century Agriculture (AC21). Organic stakeholders are well-represented on AC21. Recent recommendations from the Advisory Committee are currently being implemented by USDA agencies.\nConsumers purchase organic products expecting that they maintain their organic integrity from farm to market, and USDA is committed to meeting these expectations. No matter where it was grown, if a product has the USDA Organic label on it, it wasnt produced with GMOs.\nRelated PostsIn Texas, Tradition and Innovation are Continuing Resolutions between Tribe and NRCS\nNew Study Offers Sage Advice\nSupporting Organic Integrity with Clear Livestock and Poultry Standards\nTags: AMS, Biotechnology, Farmers, genetic engineering, GMO, National Organic Program, NOP, NRCS, organic, Organic 101, organic certification\nEnvironment, Food and Nutrition, Technology and Broadband\n103 Responses to Organic 101: Can GMOs Be Used in Organic Products?\nNewer Comments \nKeith Reding says:\n05/17/2013 at 2:37 PM\nIsnt the use of GMOs an excluded method, NOT a prohibited substance?\nThis means one cant intentiionally use the technology but if one ends up with some GMO in the final product, it doesnt remove their organic status as long as they complied with their organic plan.\nRegards,\nKeith\nCaryn Connolly says:\n05/17/2013 at 3:48 PM\nI have heard there is a specific tolerance for how much is allowed.\nIve heard that it is 0.9% because there is almost always some cross-contamination.\nIs this true?\nSteve Savage says:\n05/17/2013 at 3:53 PM\nI think it is sort of sad that an agency which does so much good and important science itself is stuck with the task of enforcing or even explaining rules that ignore the overwhelming scientific consensus that GMO foods bear no more risk than any sort of conventionally improved food.\nThen they get to administer rules which encourage the use of fertilizers derived from animal manures which have been well documented causes of human death.\nCynthia Hamilton says:\n05/17/2013 at 4:36 PM\nThe real question is, WHY are GMO foods allowed to be sold when there is NO testing done to indicate its safety?\nAnd dont give me that substantially similar excuse, that would be hybrids, not something made in a lab with genetic engineering.\nWe need GMOs taken OFF the market until theyve been proven safe by peer reviewed studies.\nXena Horvath says:\n05/17/2013 at 5:28 PM\nHey USDA, why not do your job and ban GMOs altogether!?\nThere is no proof that GMOs are safe what so ever, and if youre not going to ban them you should put a label on them so that we can make an informed choice on whether we want cancer or not.\nThis is absolutely ridiculous how much corruption there is in the USDA and the FDA.\nsheila says:\n05/17/2013 at 11:44 PM\nI asked one of my organic growers at my Farmers Market about the tolerance amount, I believe it is closer to 5%.\nSam Rosenthal says:\n05/18/2013 at 2:37 AM\nIts a travesty that organics farmers have to work so hard to prevent pollution from neighboring GMO plantings. Steve, Monsantos RoundUp Ready GMO seeds are linked to many health problems and are thus outlawed in many other countries.\nAlice Elliott Brown says:\n05/18/2013 at 8:13 AM\nSteve, its become a very odd convention that every comment board has a commenter who states that there is overwhelming scientific consensus that GMO foods bear no more risk than conventionally improved food.\nThere was an overwhelming scientific consensus that cigarettes were good for you (helped you lose weight) and that aspartame, DDT, Agent Orange, and the rest of the long list of Monsanto poisons were good for you, too.\nSo the reason the population says no, is because history says scientific consensus is bull crap.\nSteve Savage says:\n05/20/2013 at 1:13 AM\nCynthia,\nThere are literally hundreds of peer reviewed studies demonstrating the safety of GMO crops.\nThere is a list of them at the GENERA website provided by biofortified.\nA great many of them have been completely independently funded by entities that are not in that business.\nhttp://www.biofortified.org/genera/\nThis idea that there are no studies or no independent studies is essentially a lie that has been propagated on the internet.\nIve been an observer of this technology for 36 years.\nThere has never been a technology so carefully launched.\nJohn Downey says:\n05/20/2013 at 7:50 AM\nSo my question is how do you know if certain products, animal feeds, etc. contain GMOs if manufacturers are not required to label products containing GMOs? We raise chickens for egg production and do not want GMOs even though we are not certified organic.\ncrecencio elenes says:\n05/20/2013 at 9:23 AM\nMy thinking and like to share it, is that farmers that used pesticides and GMOs should be the ones putting the buffer zones, since they are the ones that can cause some damage, not organic farms, who follow more sensible management. thanks\nBruce Follett says:\n05/20/2013 at 1:16 PM\nWhy is the burden of isolation on the shoulders of the organic farmer?\nThey are using seed as nature intended.\nIt should be the contaminators responsibility to mitigate cross pollination.\nJanet O'Dell says:\n05/21/2013 at 12:41 PM\nAt least LABEL the GMOs  that way everyone can make their own choices as to what they want to eat. I am willing to bet that the GMO products will not be purchased and Monsanto and others will have to get with the program or go out of business. I buy ONLY organic now!!! Organic farmers should NOT have to watch for GMOs, those growing the GMOs should be responsible for not cross-contaminating organic crops as organic crops were here first. Why mess with natural selection and bastardize seeds and crops? Humans are playing GOD way too much for my liking.\nRay Kamalay says:\n05/23/2013 at 12:40 AM\nBut the real question is, What is the regulation banning the labelling of GMOs?\nWhen did it come into effect?\nWho was responsible for it?(Since it was worth billions of dollars)Was it a campaign contribution, or a promised job outside of Washington DC, or simply political croneyism?\nHow did it come to be, and who is responsible?\nRichard Weaver says:\n05/28/2013 at 3:48 PM\nUnfortunately some individuals (above) do not get it. People purchase organically grown produce and livestock to avoid pesticides and other un natural substances. This includes GMO. The pesticide companys would make the argument pesticides are safe, and yet they are not allowed into organics. The same can be said about GMOs. These are not natural substances. They are artifical by defination and do not occur in nature. As well, studies are now raising concerns about the safety of GMO. It will take decades to show true safety if it even exists. The studies on soil microbial environment dysruption are extremely concerning. Also, the scientists who study GMO recieve funding from the companies(thats how its done here..no independent funding exists) and sign confidentiality agreements that will not let them discuss their findings. As with pharm studies, we are finding that they dispose of the bad results and only allow the good. As far as the burdon on the farmer.as a consumer I say tough. You want the premium price for your product, then there should be a guarentee on what the consumer is getting. Ms Brown above was succinct in her sentiments. You summed it up clearly. Thankyou\nDr. Richard Weaver\nPhysician and Health Advocate\nSusan Haymore says:\n05/29/2013 at 10:15 AM\nBottom line is that it should be my decision whether I consume genetically modified food. How can I decide if I dont know? GMOs are not natural and I think labeling anything as natural when it contains GMOs violates the truth in advertising laws. Why should Monsanto be afraid of labeling if they think GMOs are harmless?\nMegan Cooper says:\n05/30/2013 at 12:50 AM\nSteve, please explain your background. I see you wrote a defense of plant patents, posted to GENERA. I would like to know if anything in your history specifically touches on human biology, epigenetics, or chemistry.\nRespectfully,\nMegan\nDehl Jossi says:\n05/31/2013 at 11:31 PM\nBasically most all conventional foods now contain GMO contamination in some form or another. Look up http://www.nongmoshoppingguide.com to be informed of foods that are GMO free. We must stop buying the contaminated food and vote for labeling with our dollar. I love it that companies are now choosing to label products that dont have GMOs. The reason these bio tech companies are so against labeling is for one they know how bad they are for the environment and our bodies and for two basically every conventional processed food product would have to be labeled and they know they would be out of business. The most disappointing thing is that the USDA and the FDA supports this crap. I have farmed for a living for 25 years, third generation farmer and am both conventional and Organic and my Organic crops are so much better!! I really enjoy Organic farming. I believe the whole agricultural system in the U.S. is going to crash and there will be a famine here some day because the soil is being poisoned and destroyed by all the crop protection poisons that are now on the market. You can only play God so long with out consequences.\nBrad says:\n06/01/2013 at 12:14 PM\nSteve, why are you here to defend the interests of global corporations determined to commodify and engineer our food supply? There is plenty of evidence that some GMOs are potentially dangerous and there is no conclusive evidence that they are safe. In any case, a food engineered at the genetic level in a manner that could not naturally occur should not be considered organic as it is the antithesis of such.\nJanet O'Dell says:\n06/04/2013 at 5:08 PM\nKansas wheat farmer sues Monsanto for contaminating his wheat  like it!\nhttp://weather.yahoo.com/kansas-wheat-farmer-sues-monsanto-over-rogue-wheat-155201442.html\nKathy Burns says:\n06/07/2013 at 8:08 AM\nAmen Delh Jossi!\nMan has overstepped his boundaries in trying to control nature.\nWe have made vast technological improvements to aid man in all walks of life, but we must not try to change the natural order of life on earth.\nJust this spring numerous articles were released linking sudden hive collapse in honey bees to GMO corn.\n(search on GMO AND honey bee sudden hive collapse) As a beekeeper and organic gardener with GMO corn grown widely in NE Indiana, I am greatly concerned.\nThanks to all above for the insightful comments.\nKathy\nConcerned citizen says:\n06/09/2013 at 1:40 AM\nI think labeling is in order. We WANT to know what we are eating and putting into our bodies. All food needs to be labeled if it has been altered and is GMOs. The USDA needs to comply with the people of the United States of America and require labeling of these geneticlly modified foods. Study after study is now revealing that GMOs can be tied to many Heath issues.\nMB Fournier says:\n06/11/2013 at 11:01 PM\nAll I know is that if I am a conscious consumer I have the right to know what has or hasnt been done to the food I purchase for my familys consumption. If there is nothing for Monsanto to hide or be concerned about their GMO crops, then they should be PROUD to label their fine scientific achievements in agriculture and prove how superior they are in taste, quality and safety to organic and non-GMO!\nJennifer Andersen says:\n06/14/2013 at 5:39 PM\nMysterious Steve, the defender of all things GMO. We would respect you and your points about safety if you proudly defended GMO labelling as a way to promote GMO products. Why not? Everyone who has a great product loves to promote it!\nI would definitely have more respect and listen to the arguments you so eloquently serve up.\nBut  what about the method used to get the foreign gene  gene on its own perfectly safe \ninto the plant genome?\nAs I understand it, the gene gets randomly inserted by means of transposons and so we dont know where it lands in the plant genome.\nIt could insert itself into the middle of a gene that performs, not one function, but many functions.\nWe dont know the effects of inserting the safe gene into random spots in the plant DNA. Until we really know, what is the harm in straightforwardly labelling GMO products?\nsvetlana says:\n06/16/2013 at 2:06 AM\nIt is ridiculous congress is allowing the Monsantos of the world to take over our food.\nWhy cant we have a bill that supports\nsmall local farmers ??? Why is Monsanto considered a farmer ? It is a chemical company ! We should subsidize\nsmall local organic farmers, so we can have access to healthy raw foods. Lets get rid of politicians who support chemical companies that tell us their products are good for us, ie ddt, agent orange, milk additives, pesticide, GMO foods ? You want us to believe these foods ARE SAFE ? Why are you passing legislation that supports companies with such a HORRIBLE reputation. Who are the idiots ? Me ? You ? All of us ? I need someone to explain this to me. What underhanded trick is congress hiding in this bill ? Will it benefit the PEOPLE or Monsanto and their congressional prostitutes.. We should make it illegal for congress to benefit in any way from legislation they pass for any special interest group. We should not allow armies of special interest lobbyists. I am mad. I want honest legislation, honest congressmen and clean raw food.\nRenee says:\n06/23/2013 at 8:08 PM\nIts just so sad.. the corruption and greed.\nReally wish I could just pick up and move to a country led by brighter, non-corrupt individuals.\nMaria says:\n07/01/2013 at 9:38 AM\nSee the movie FOOD, Inc\nIt is gross how\nindustrial\nthe food supply has become.\nSickening.\nCharles Sutherland says:\n08/01/2013 at 9:44 AM\nI have tried to summarize the pervasive corruption and dangers to our health, and to the health of infants, in the book The Poison Planters, and, in doing the research I was appalled at how many people in the government are on the take from Monsanto and the other GMO companies.\nIts really disheartening.\nCharles Sutherland\nNicole Rolfe says:\n08/04/2013 at 5:39 PM\nAs a mother I am outraged by the amount of work and research I have to do before purchasing food to ensure what my family eats does not contain GMOs.\nFDA do your job!\nWe have the right to know what is in our food.\nJim Davis says:\n08/10/2013 at 9:19 AM\nGood grief, people.. seems to me the certified organic program is trying to ensure that people have a choice. If you dont care about GMOs or you WANT them, then dont buy certified organic.\nIf youre non-GMO and have issues with the standards then let them know.\nErick the Beard says:\n08/16/2013 at 5:01 AM\nDid Steve disappear?\nScrew the government and their agenda. Be self sufficient, buy local, buy fresh, and buy organic. Find Christ. Lucifer is working overtime as he knows his time is short. California has stolen the innocence of all schoolchildren to accommodate the .0001%.\nIsaiah 5:20\n20 Woe unto them that call evil good, and good evil; that put darkness for light, and light for darkness; that put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter!\nNicole Rolfe says:\n08/18/2013 at 7:20 AM\nKansas wheat farmer sues Monsanto for contaminating his wheat  like it!\nSue Peters says:\n08/24/2013 at 7:50 PM\nJennifer, nicely put.\nSteve  I am an avid supporter of technology with a background in mobile tech, and I also do brain research, so I am definitely not a luddite. I suffered for 10 years with a chronic pain illness, that was cured by removing grains, GMOs and pesticide laden foods from my diet. It seems silly to me that we have massive government organizations like the USDA, FDA, and US Dept of Health, who end up offsetting the work or goals of each other. These foods may not effect you, but they do effect a growing population of individuals suffering from chronic illnesses that seem to originate in the gut.\nIf you care, and youd like to learn more about how these foods do create pain and suffering for others, humans and animals, check out http://www.geneticroulettemovie.com\nDiane E Adams says:\n08/25/2013 at 4:46 PM\nThere are a handful of pure seed companies left. We need to support them and the non-GMO companies, natural and organically grown.\nAs an organic fertilizer sales company, I have been reading on GMO foods to know what my transitioning farmers are going through as they move to an organic or natural farming process.\nAs simple as I can explain from my limited knowledge. The main advantage of GMO crops -right- is so the crop can be sprayed with a Monsanto or other produced herbicide and the crop will not die, though the weeds will.\nBut the GMO crop loses a great percentage of nutritional value due to damage to roots and the good bacteria has been killed off, the uptake is not there. That is how the weeds are killed, the crops is affected but does not die.\nThe crops also die earlier and earlier each year and they do not have the desired yields due to this effect.\nThis result can take a decade but it does occur.\nThe soil life is poisoned and killed by the Roundup or other herbicide used.\nTheoretically, there can only be Roundup Ready GMO seeds planted there from now on because the soil is poisoned and other crops will suffer and even die.\nFarms and market growers who are transitioning to healthy land again, they have to fertilize heavily to regain soil health while the herbicides are degrading in the soil, this can take three or more years.\nTheir crops are limited, but they are possible.\nThe farms cannot be called natural or organic for a very long time, it could take two decades to get there.\nBut they are changing, only I believe it could be too little too late because of the wayward thrust of the giant and the farms that are not changing.\nJohn Hilliard says:\n09/04/2013 at 6:37 AM\nThis is worth reading- it answers many misconceptions in these comments: The European Commission is the executive body of the European Union.\nThe main conclusion to be drawn from the efforts of more than 130 research projects, covering a period of more than 25 years of research, and involving more than 500 independent research groups, is that biotechnology, and in particular, GMOs, or no more risky than conventional plant breeding technologies.\nhttp://ec.europa.eu/research/biosociety/pdf/a_decade_of_eu-funded_gmo_research.pdf\nJohn Hilliard says:\n09/04/2013 at 2:34 PM\nI am disappointed the scientists and academics at the USDA do not participate in clarifying the current state of knowledge concerning GMOs. Clearly there is a need evidenced by the near hysteria in some of these comments.\nJohn Hilliard says:\n09/04/2013 at 3:12 PM\nI am disappointed we do not hear from the scientists and academics at the USDA. Do they not participate in clarifying the current state of knowledge concerning GMOs. Clearly there is a need evidenced by the near hysteria and profound lack of knowledge in some of these comments.\nJeff says:\n09/12/2013 at 12:34 PM\nConcerning organic products that are %95 organic, the other 5 percent are conventional and non GMO?\nI am reading different things on that other 5%. Thanks.\nDave Sansone says:\n09/14/2013 at 11:58 PM\nThe EU study Jillian Hilliard cites is a joke.\nThere are no human or animal studies in it.\nOn study is The Sustainable Introduction of New GMOs.\nGMO contaminatio of organic food is the rule.\nBig Island HAwaii has 50% contamination of non gmo papayas.\nIf a farmer wants to verify their papayas arent GMO, they mustpay $3 per plant for a test created by opponents of the GMO papaya.\nHawaii is overrun with GMO field trials of experimental crops, how can an organic farmer really know what genetics they have.\nToo bad there is only one human studyit indicates that 3 out of 7 peoples gut bacteria uptook the RoundUp ready gene.\nOhoh, do we owe monsanto now?\nCae Joy says:\n09/18/2013 at 3:05 PM\nClearly, the public sentiment on this USDA blog is for informed choices regarding our food supply, and proof that GMOs are not harmful. I whole-heartedly agree! So, the question is, where is the response to these concerns from\nthe USDA? Isnt the point of the blog to address consumer concerns and to find out what the public thinks? The public has spoken. What are you going to do about it USDA?\nPhoebe Saffold says:\n10/19/2013 at 10:13 AM\nAll I am asking is that we required clear GMO labeling on all food and food ingredients sold in grocery stores and any other major distributors.\nLet the people decide what they want to buy.\nLeslie Armstrong says:\n10/31/2013 at 1:41 PM\nAlso a fervent believer in the health and nutritional benefits of organic farming.\nGMOs are junk food, soil destroyers, population sickeners, and a cash cow of the biotech industries. I looked at that EU report as well.\nRegurgitation of biotech propaganda and indeed, no studies on animals or people.\nYou can find some studies, though, on animals (and they are gross, naturally) by going to the Institute for Responsible Technology website. There are also good documentaries on Netflix. Great information, albeit depressing.\nSeems like we have to fight fire with fire now, meaning money with money and, thanks largely to vast corporate profit driven interests, theyve also successfully devastated our job market and kept wages low for 30+ years.\nBout all I can afford now is the luxury to buy organic products.\nFDA and USDA you are not just useless, but 100% anti-American in that you in no way stand up for the common good and are bought off just like the politicians.\nI am not wrong.\nLook for CANCER: THE FOBIDDEN CURES\non free documentaries online.\nMax Truth says:\n12/01/2013 at 4:47 PM\nSteve,\nYou are clearly either severely uninformed or a GMO, Monsanto stooge. I lean towards the later. Since the evidence against GMOs is overwhelming, how about you provide us one real-world scenario or example where GMO crops have helped anyone, the environment or otherwise. The myth that they provide higher yields has been debunked via statistics. Your right Steve, the poor dirt, organic farmers of America simply have it out for poor ol Billion Dollar Monsanto.\nRichard Stone says:\n12/15/2013 at 6:32 PM\nI have the same question as Jeff (9/13): What is in the other 5% of USDA-seal products. I know that it cant be just anythingtheres something called the National List of Allowed and Prohibited Substances, http://www.ams.usda.gov/AMSv1.0/ams.fetchTemplateData.do?template=TemplateJ&page=NOPNationalList, which goes into great detail about what can and cant be included. But I have yet to get the patience to analyze this carefully. I have read that no gmo ingredient can be used in the other 5%, but I dont remember where.\nWhatever the rule, I believe that the same rules apply to the other up-to 30% of non-organic ingredients in products which say Made with organic so and so on the main label panel.\nRichard Stone says:\n12/15/2013 at 6:43 PM\nOK, here is a site which seems to do a good job of attacking this vexing question. Unfortunately the answer is not certain, but usually. They discuss the issue in great detail: http://gmo-awareness.com/2011/05/05/is-organic-always-gmo-free/\nJohn says:\n01/19/2014 at 12:34 AM\nWhy cant america have europes standards?\nIm liking america less and less every day as a citizen here.\nYaaaay, freedom and liberty and all that crap that allow monsanto and dow to do as they please. Im moving to italy.

Whats with all the secrecy if there is nothing to hide?\nJanice Smith says:\n02/24/2014 at 2:40 PM\nI agree with Sandra Sweazie.\nWhat can happen to companies who produce GMO products if all products are labeled GMO?\nNancy Harrison says:\n02/25/2014 at 6:27 PM\nI cant understand why the organic farmers, who are not spreading contaminated seed, are being given the burden of insuring themselves, when it should be the GMO seed providers, whose seeds are contaminating the area, who should be made to bear the financial burden. Yet again, Monsanto is being protected from the consequences of its actions.\nThe problem, and it is a huge one, is that Monsanto essentially owns the USDA (look at the background of USDA top brass over the last 2 decades) and can control what it says, does, and rules.\nNewer Comments \nLeave a Reply\nCancel Reply\nName (required)\nMail (will not be published) (required)\nWelcome to the USDA Blog Read our Comment Policy\nCategories\nAmerican Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) (202)\nCivil Rights (19)\nClimate Change (170)\nConservation (925)\nEconomic Growth (449)\nEducation (341)\nEn Espaol (39)\nEnergy (248)\nEnvironment (637)\nFood and Nutrition (1498)\nFood Safety (327)\nFood Security (155)\nForestry (947)\nInternational (283)\nKnow Your Farmer, Know Your Food (444)\nLet's Move (230)\nNew and Beginning Farmers (22)\nPeople's Garden (170)\nPlant and Animal Health (273)\nRural Development (1305)\nScience (598)\nTechnology and Broadband (210)\nTrade (272)\nUSDA Results (54)\nWomen in Ag (55)\nSign up for Email Updates\nCalendar\nMay 2013\nM\nT\nW\nT\nF\nS\nS\n Apr\nJun \n12345\n6789101112\n13141516171819\n20212223242526\n2728293031\nTag CloudAMS\nAPHIS\nARRA\nARS\nCalifornia\nClimate Change\nConservation\nEnergy\nERS\nFarm Bill\nFarmers\nFAS\nFNS\nFood and Nutrition\nFood Farm and Jobs Bill\nFood Safety\nForestry\nFS\nFSA\nFSIS\nHealthierNextGen\nKYF2\nLet's Move\nMyPlate\nNASS\nNational School Lunch Program\nNIFA\nNRCS\nNutrition\nOregon\nPresident Obama\nProducers\nRanchers\nRD\nRural America\nrural communities\nRural Development\nschool meals\nScience Tuesday\nSNAP\nTexas\nTrade\nTribal\nUSDA\nWashington DC\nArchives\nSelect Month\nFebruary 2017\nJanuary 2017\nDecember 2016\nNovember 2016\nOctober 2016\nSeptember 2016\nAugust 2016\nJuly 2016\nJune 2016\nMay 2016\nApril 2016\nMarch 2016\nFebruary 2016\nJanuary 2016\nDecember 2015\nNovember 2015\nOctober 2015\nSeptember 2015\nAugust 2015\nJuly 2015\nJune 2015\nMay 2015\nApril 2015\nMarch 2015\nFebruary 2015\nJanuary 2015\nDecember 2014\nNovember 2014\nOctober 2014\nSeptember 2014\nAugust 2014\nJuly 2014\nJune 2014\nMay 2014\nApril 2014\nMarch 2014\nFebruary 2014\nJanuary 2014\nDecember 2013\nNovember 2013\nOctober 2013\nSeptember 2013\nAugust 2013\nJuly 2013\nJune 2013\nMay 2013\nApril 2013\nMarch 2013\nFebruary 2013\nJanuary 2013\nDecember 2012\nNovember 2012\nOctober 2012\nSeptember 2012\nAugust 2012\nJuly 2012\nJune 2012\nMay 2012\nApril 2012\nMarch 2012\nFebruary 2012\nJanuary 2012\nDecember 2011\nNovember 2011\nOctober 2011\nSeptember 2011\nAugust 2011\nJuly 2011\nJune 2011\nMay 2011\nApril 2011\nMarch 2011\nFebruary 2011\nJanuary 2011\nDecember 2010\nNovember 2010\nOctober 2010\nSeptember 2010\nAugust 2010\nJuly 2010\nJune 2010\nMay 2010\nApril 2010\nMarch 2010\nFebruary 2010\nJanuary 2010\nDecember 2009\nNovember 2009\nOctober 2009\nSeptember 2009\nAugust 2009\nJuly 2009\nJune 2009\nMay 2009\nApril 2009\nMarch 2009\nUSDA.gov |\nSite Map |\nPolicies & Links |\nOur Performance |\nReport Fraud on USDA Contracts |\nVisit OIG |\nPlain Writing\n|\nOpen\nFOIA |\nAccessibility Statement |\nPrivacy Policy |\nNon-Discrimination Statement |\nInformation Quality |\nUSDA Recovery |\nUSA.gov |\nWhitehouse.gov"
