Its important to note that steering clear of these foods completely may be difficult, and you should merely try to find other sources than your big chain grocer.If produce is certified USDA-organic, its non-GMO (or supposed to be!) Also, seek out local farmers and booths at farmers markets where you can be ensured that the crops arent GMO. Even better, if you are so inclined: Start organic gardening and grow them yourself.Until then, here arethe top 10 worst GMO foods for your do not eat GMO foods list.\nGMO Foods List: Top 10 Worst Foods\n1.Corn\nOne of the most prominent GMO foods, avoiding corn is a no-brainer. If youve watched any food documentary, you know corn is highly modified. As many as half of all U.S. farms growing corn for Monsanto are using genetically modified corn, and much of it is intended for human consumption. Monsantos GMO corn has been tied to numerous health issues, including weight gain and organ disruption.\n2.Soy\nFound in tofu, vegetarian products, soybean oil, soy flour, and numerous other products, soy is also modified to resist herbicides.As of now, biotech giant Monsanto still has a tight grasp on the soybean market, with approximately 90 percent of soy being genetically engineered to resist Monsantos herbicide Roundup. In one single year, 2006, there was 96.7 million pounds of glyphosate sprayed on soybeans alone.\n3.Sugar\nAccording to NaturalNews, genetically-modified sugar beets were introduced to the U.S. market in 2009. Like others, theyve been modified by Monsanto to resist herbicides. Monsanto has even had USDA and court-related issues with the planting of its sugarbeets, being ordered to remove seeds from the soil due to illegal approval.\n4.Aspartame\nAspartame is a toxic additive used in numerous food products, and should be avoided for numerous reasons, including the fact that it is created with genetically modified bacteria.\n5.Papayas\nThis one may come as a surprise to all of you tropical-fruit lovers. GMO papayas have been grown in Hawaii for consumption since 1999. Though they cant be sold to countries in the European Union, they are welcome with open arms in the U.S. and Canada.\n6.Canola\nOne of the most chemically altered foods in the U.S. diet, canola oil is obtained from rapeseed through a series of chemical actions.\n7.Cotton\nFound in cotton oil, cotton originating in India and China in particular has serious risks.\n8.Dairy\nYour dairy products may contain growth hormones, since as many as one-fifth of all dairy cows in America are pumped with these hormones. In fact, Monasntos health-hazardous rBGH has been banned in 27 countries, but is still in most US cows. If you must drink milk, buy organic.\n9. and 10. Zucchini and Yellow Squash\nClosely related, these two squash varieties are modified to resist viruses.\nThe dangers of some of these foods are well-known. The Bt toxin being used in GMO corn, for example, was recently detected in the blood of pregnant women and their babies. But perhaps more frightening are the risks that are still unknown. Even while these foods should be on your GMO foods list so that they are avoided, you can buy 100% organic to be safest.\nWith little regulation and safety tests performed by the companies doing the genetic modifications themselves, we have no way of knowing for certain what risks these lab-created foods pose to us outside of what we already know.\nThe best advice: steer clear of them altogether.\nAdditional Sources:\nNaturalNews\nOther Popular Stories:\nGlyphosate, Most Widely Used Weed Killer, Still Isnt Killing Weeds\nExposure to Certain Foods in Infancy May Prevent Future Allergies\nPrevious PostNext Post\nGet The NaturalSociety Natural Health Newsletter!\nGet the latest key natural health information from NaturalSociety with our daily newsletter, and receive three free health guides and one full length E-book!\nNewsletter\nFollow\nNatural Society\nEssential Stories\nReinventing the Wheel: Nestle Reformulates Sugar\nJulie Fidler\nDecember 8, 2016\nIs the Soda Industry Hiding Health Risks of Drinking Soda?\nJulie Fidler\nDecember 7, 2016\nFirst Human Injected with Controversial Genetically Modified Genes\nJulie Fidler\nDecember 1, 2016\nCongress Prepares to Vote on Bill That Would Speed up Drug Approval\nJulie Fidler\nNovember 30, 2016\nIncoming Trump Administration is Shaping up to be Very Pro-GMO\nJulie Fidler\nNovember 29, 2016\nCould Turmeric be a Solid Natural Solution for Alzheimers?\nAlexandra Preston\nNovember 17, 2016\nCheck out Natural Society's Polls on LockerDome on LockerDome\nViral Stories\nHome Remedies for Hemorrhoids  6 Natural Treatments\n16 Magnesium Deficiency Symptoms  Signs of Low Magnesium Levels\nHealth Benefits of Dates  Promoting Heart, Brain, and Digestive Health\nTop 10 Worst GMO Foods for Your GMO Foods List\n10 Health Benefits of Black Seed (Nigella Sativa)  Part 1\nThe Numbers on Plastic Bottles: What do Plastic Recycling Symbols Mean?\nHome\nAbout Natural Society\nPrivacy Policy\nDisclaimer\nAdvertise\nNewsletter\nWork with Us\nContact\n2017 Natural Society.
