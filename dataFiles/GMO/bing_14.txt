This relatively new science creates unstable combinations of plant, animal, bacterial and viral genes that do not occur in nature or through traditional crossbreeding methods.\nGenetic modification affects many of the products we consume on a daily basis. As the number of GMOs available for commercial use grows every year, the Non-GMO Project works diligently to provide the most accurate, up-to-date standards for non-GMO verification.\nIn order for a product to be Non-GMO Project Verified, its inputsmust be evaluated for compliance with our standard, which categorizes inputs into three risk levels:\nRisk Level\nDefinition\nExamples\nHigh-Risk\nThe input is derived from, contains derivatives of, or is produced through a process involving organisms that are known to be genetically modified and commercially available.\nAlfalfa, Canola, Corn, Cotton, Papaya, Soy, Sugar beet, Yellow summer squash / zucchini, Animal products, Microbes and enzymes\nLow-Risk\nThe input is not derived from, does not contain derivatives of, or is not produced through a process involving organisms that are presently known to be genetically modified and commercially available.\nLentils, Spinach, Tomatoes, Sesame seeds, Avocados\nNon-Risk\nThe input is not derived from biological organisms and not, therefore, susceptible to genetic modification.\nThough there are only several GM crops that are widely available, they are commodity crops that often get further processed into a variety of ingredients. These high-risk ingredients are typically present in packaged products as:\nAmino acids, alcohol, aspartame, ascorbic acid, sodium ascorbate, citric acid, sodium citrate, ethanol, flavorings (natural and artificial), high-fructose corn syrup, hydrolyzed vegetable protein, lactic acid, maltodextrins, molasses, monosodium glutamate (MSG), sucrose, textured vegetable protein (TVP), xanthan gum, vitamins, vinegar, yeast products\nThe Non-GMO Project Standard considers animal-derived products such as meat, dairy, eggs and honey to be high risk due to the prevalence of GMOs in animal feed. Cloned animals and their progeny are considered to be GMOs under the standard, as are the products of synthetic biology.\nLearn more\nGMO Science\nLatest on Facebook Non-GMO Project 5 hours ago "GMOs are part of an agricultural system that is not environmentally or socially sustainable." ...
