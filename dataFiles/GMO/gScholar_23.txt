The lengths of corresponding bones tend to be proportional to (body mass)035 and the diameters to (body mass)036, except in the family Bovidae in which the exponents for length are much nearer the value of 025 predicted by McMahon's (1973) theory of elastic similarity. Comparisons are made between mammals of similar size belonging to different orders.\nGet access to the full text of this article\nAncillaryArticle InformationDOI10.1111/j.1469-7998.1979.tb03964.xView/save citationFormat AvailableFull text: PDF\nRequest Permissions\nPublication HistoryIssue online: 20 August 2009Version of record online: 20 August 2009Accepted 10 April 1979Related content\nArticles related to the one you are viewingPlease enable Javascript to view the related content of this article.Citing Literature\nNumber of times cited: 1641Mauricio A.
