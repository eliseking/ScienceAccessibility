Panel on Genetically Modified Organisms
GMO
The Panel on Genetically Modified Organisms (GMO) provides independent scientific advice on food and feed safety, environmental risk assessment and molecular characterisation/plant science. Its work chiefly concerns genetically-modified plants, micro-organisms and animals.
GMO PanelMembers are scientists from across Europewith expertise in:
Food and feed safety assessment (GM-plants, GM-microorganisms, GM-animals)
Food and genetic toxicology, immunology, food allergy, human and animal nutrition, dietary exposure, biochemistry and metabolism, food chemistry, compositional analysis statistics and field trial design, animal feeding trials
Environmental risk assessment (GM-plants, GM-microorganisms and GM-animals)
Insect ecology and population dynamics, plant ecology, molecular ecology, ecotoxicology, plant biology, plant pathology, plant physiology, weed science, ecosystem services, soil science (soil organisms, biochemical processes, abiotic processes), plant population genetics, resistance evolution in target pest organisms (entomology, crop protection), geographical zoning and receiving environments, pest science (plant protection), impact of agriculture on biodiversity, vertical gene flow, horizontal gene flow, persistence and invasiveness (weediness), impact on non-target organisms (entomology, ecology), mathematical modelling, statistics and biometry, experimental design (field trial design, laboratory test design), agronomy, cropping systems and agricultural practices
Molecular characterisation and plant science
Genome structure and evolution, gene regulation, genome stability, bioinformatics, plant breeding, molecular biology, plant and microbial physiology, biochemistry and metabolism (plants, microorganisms), proteomics, transcriptomics, genomics, genetic transformation, plant biology, food microbiology, antibiotic resistance, mathematical modelling, horizontal gene transfer, expression analysis, protein analysis, environmental microbiology, genetics, ecology.
