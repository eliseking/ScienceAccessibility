b'GMO\nGenetically Modified Organisms (GMO):\nWhen a gene from one organism is purposely moved to improve\nor change another organism in a laboratory, the result is a genetically\nmodified organism (GMO). It is also sometimes called "transgenic"\nfor transfer of genes.\nThere are different ways of moving genes to produce desirable\ntraits. For both plants and animals, one of the more traditional ways\nis through selective breeding. For example, a plant with a desired trait\nis chosen and bred to produce more plants with the desirable trait. More\nrecently with the advancement of technology is another technique. This\ntechnique is applied in the laboratory where genes that express the desired\ntrait is physically moved or added to a new plant to enhance the trait\nin that plant. Plants produced with this technology are transgenic. Often,\nthis process is performed on crops to produce insect or herbicide resistant\nplants, they are referred to as Genetically Modified Crops (GM crops).\nResults of insect infestation on Bt (right) and non-Bt (left) cotton\nbolls.

Insulin\nused in medicine is an example of genetic engineering; the insulin gene\nfrom the intestines of pigs is inserted into bacteria. The bacterium grows\nand produces insulin; this insulin is then purified and used for medical\npurposes. Thyroid hormones, until recently was derived only from animals,\nnow the hormone can be cultured from bacteria. Other genetically engineered\nproducts include the chemical Aspartame used in sugar free foods, and\nthe drug hepatitis B vaccine.\nEngineering vs breeding\nSo why use molecular biology over traditional breeding?\nWith traditional breeding, plants often exchange large, unregulated chunks\nof their genomes. This can lead to both useful and unwanted traits in\nthe offspring. Sometimes these unwanted traits can be unsafe. One example\nwould be potato varieties made using conventional plant breeding that\ninadvertently produced excessive levels of naturally occuring glycoalkoloids.\nThese glycoalkoloids cause cause gastrointestinal, circulatory, neurological\nand dermatological problems associated with alkaloid poisoning.\nBreeders sometimes have to cross many plants over multiple\ngenerations to produce the desired trait. GM techniques allow new traits\nto be introduced one at a time without complications from extra genes\nand extensive crossbreeding. GM techniques also allow traits from different\norganisms to be applied, such as pest resistance.\nTypes of GM plants\nMost GM crops grown today have been developed to resist\ncertain insect pests. There are GM plants being developed today to produce\nspecific vitamins, resist plant viruses and even produce products for\nmedical uses. Countries that grow GM crops include; Argentina, Australia,\nCanada, China, Germany, India, Indonesia, Mexico, Portugal, South Africa,\nSpain, United States, Ukraine, and many more.'
