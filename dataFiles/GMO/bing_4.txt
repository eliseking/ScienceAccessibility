This relatively new science creates unstable combinations of plant, animal, bacterial and viral genes that do not occur in nature or through traditional crossbreeding methods. Visit the What is GMO page for more information and a list of high-risk crops.\nAre GMOs safe?\nMost developed nations do not consider GMOs to be safe and have significant restrictions or outright bans on the production and sale of GMOs. The U.S. and Canadian governments, though, have approved GMOs based on studies conducted by the same corporations that created them and profit from their sale.\nAre GMOs labelled?\nSixty-four countries around the world, including Australia, Japan, and all of the countries in the European Union, require genetically modified foods to be labelled1.While a 2015 ABC News survey found that 93% of Americans believe genetically modified foods should be labelled, GMOs are not required to be labelled in the U.S. and Canada2. In the absence of mandatory labeling, the Non-GMO Project was created to give consumers the informed choice they deserve.\nWhich foods might contain GMOs?\nMost packaged foods contain ingredients derived from corn, soy, canola, and sugar beet  and the vast majority of those crops grown in North America are genetically modified3. To see a list of high-risk crops, visit the What is GMOpage.\nHow do GMOs affect farmers?\nBecause GMOs are novel life forms, biotechnology companies have been able to obtain patents with which to restrict their use. As a result, the companies that make GMOs now have the power to sue farmers whose fields are contaminated with GMOs, even when it is the result of inevitable drift from neighboring fields4. GMOs therefore pose a serious threat to farmer sovereignty and to the national food security of any country where they are grown, including the United States and Canada.\nWhat are the impacts of GMOs on the environment?\nMore than 80% of all GMOs grown worldwide are engineered for herbicide tolerance5. As a result, use of toxic herbicides like Roundup has increased 16 times since GMOs were introduced6. GM crops are also responsible for the emergence of herbicide resistant super weeds and super bugs, which can only be killed with more toxic poisons like 2,4-D (a major ingredient in Agent Orange)7,8. GMOs are a direct extension of chemical agriculture and are developed and sold by the worlds biggest chemical companies. The long-term impacts of GMOs are unknown, and once released into the environment, these novel organisms cannot be recalled.\nCenter for Food Safety | Issues | GE Food Labeling | International Labeling Laws.
