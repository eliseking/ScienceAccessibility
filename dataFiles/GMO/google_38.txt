Why do farmers use GMOs?
Farmers choose seeds based on what is best for their farms, market demand and local growing environments. Farmers select GMOs to reduce yield loss or crop damage from weeds, diseases, and insects, as well as from extreme weather conditions,such as
drought.Farmers choose to use GMOs to reduce the impact of agriculture on their environment and their costs  by applying pesticides in more targeted ways, for example. Farmers have also used GMOs to save a crop  such as papaya from Hawaii  that was being threatened by a disease.

European Corn Borer
One of corns primary pests that damage the ears of corn, as well as the stalks, by chewing tunnels, causing the corn plants to fall over. In recent years, the planting of genetically modified corn which is resistant to the European corn borer has helped farmers control this pest without chemicals and drastically reduce the harm caused to their crop.

How do I know which foods dont contain GMO ingredients?
Products with the USDA Organic label are required by law not to use GMOs in their food production. Some companies also voluntarily label products as non-GMO.
There is a current and voluntary system for retailers to designate GMO and organic produce. SKU Produce Look-Ups or PLUs that start with the number 8 designate GM produce and with the number 9 organic produce. This system was developed by the Produce Marketing Association. It is an example of a voluntary system that already exists and could be more widely adopted. For example, the PLU code for a standard yellow banana is 4011 while an organically grown standard yellow banana would be 94011.

What about the Flavr Savr Tomato?
The Flavr Savr tomato was the first GMO product to be available commercially in the United States in 1994. It was created to be less perishable. Weak harvests and costly shipping methods combined to create an unprofitable tomato. As a result, the Flavr Savr tomato was commercialized for only three years.
Are there any fish genes in a tomato or other plant on the market today?
That is fiction not fact. Such claims do scare a lot of people away from GM foods, yet the fact is no produce or vegetable product on the market contains fish genes or genes from any other animal.
You might be thinking about research that a small biotech company did many decades ago. This attempt at copying fish genes into produce was never commercialized. Many, many ideas are researched in science but few make it past the development phase. This was one of them.
What about produce like Pluots and Broccoliflower?
No GMO here. These are crops created through other genetic processes such as selective breeding.
The very big apples are GMOs right?
No GMO here. There are currently no GM apples on the market. A GM apple that is non-browning may be coming to the market in a few years, but today no GM apples are available. The only GM produce on the market is squash, papaya and some sweet corn.
We are seeing an increase in allergies and gluten intolerance. What about gluten allergies being caused by GMOs?
No relationship. There is no GM wheat on the market today.
Further, standard GM testing and FDA review ensure GMOs arent introducing NEW potential allergens. So if a GM plant were to come to market, it could not cause new allergies.
Finally, it is important to note that researcherscarefully avoid using unique genes associated with milk, eggs, wheat, fish, shellfish, tree nuts, soy and legumes  the eight major food allergens, which account for 90 percent of all food allergy cases in the US. In addition, GMOs are comprehensively evaluated for numerous other factors, which are associated with allergenic potential, such as protein structure and digestibility.

GM seeds take an average of $136 million and 13 years to bring to market because of extensive research as well as regulatory approvals conducted by the USDA, EPA and FDA, and dozens of other regulatory agencies around the world. Thousands of new non-GM varieties that enter the market, including new organic and conventional seeds, are not required to go through the extensive research and safety scrutiny that is applied to GMOs.
Scientific authorities such as the U.S. National Academies of Science, the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, the World Health Organization, the American Medical Association and the American Association for the Advancement of Science have looked at hundreds of scientific studies and have concluded that foods with biotech-derived ingredients do not pose any more risks to people than any other foods.

Precise Understanding of PlantsWhen creating a GMO, researchers copy specific genetic information from one plant or organism and introduce it into another to improve or enhance a specific characteristic or trait, such as resistance to insects. The researchers characterize very precisely what change they are making to the plant's genome,and how it will impact the metabolism of the plant cells. The plants are then extensively tested in the greenhouse and field, andresearchers look for any difference between the GM plant and conventional plants. Plants grown in the field across a range of environments are also harvested and analyzedfor their compositional makeup.

The Same as Other CropsBiotech crops currently available on the market are the same from a compositional and nutritional standpoint as their non-GM counterparts, for example, GM corn is the same as non-GM corn. Testing has shown and FDA review has confirmed that GMOs are nutritionally the same as non-GM crops, including the same levels of key nutrients like amino acids, proteins, fiber, minerals and vitamins.

Do GMOs cause allergies?
No, GMOs do not cause allergies which are not already present due to other factors unrelated to GMOs.
In fact, researchers deliberately avoid using unique genes associated with milk, eggs, wheat, fish, shellfish, tree nuts, soy and legumes  the eight major food allergens, which account for 90 percent of all food allergy cases in the US. In addition, GMOs are comprehensively evaluated for numerous other factors, which are associated with allergenic potential, such as protein structure and digestibility.
It is important to remember that if a person is allergic to a non-GM plant, they will be allergic to their GMO counterpart that is currently on the market because they are nutritionally the same. But GMOs do not introduce any new allergens.
Do GMOs cause gluten intolerance?
No relationship. There is no GM wheat on the market today.
Further, standard GM testing and FDA review ensure GMOs arent introducing NEW potential allergens. So if a GM Wheat were to come to market, it could not cause new allergies.

Do GMOs cause cancer, etc.?
No. There has never been any credible study or data associating GMOs and cancer. The few studies that have made such claims have been soundly debunked by the international scientific community. Further, the FDA and other regulatory agencies around the world in places like Europe and Asia have reviewed these studies and found them not to be credible.
In the years that farmers have grown crops from GM seeds (since 1996), there has not been a single documented instance of human harm, including new allergic reactions to foods produced with them.

The evolution of crop improvement Building on genetic diversity
Farmers have intentionally changed the genetic makeup of all the crops they have grown and the livestock they have raised since domestic agriculture began 10,000 years ago. Every fruit, vegetable and grain that is commercially available today has been altered by human hands, including organic and heirloom seeds.
In the late 20th century, advances in technology enabled us to expand the genetic diversity of crops. For years, university, government and company scientists intensively researched and refined this process. A major result has been GM seeds that maintain or increase the yield of crops while requiring less land and fewer inputs, both of which lessen the impact of agriculture on the environment and reduce costs for farmers.

10,000 years ago Humans begin crop domestication.They use selective breeding to produce better and better crops. This means saving just the seeds that have the desired traits for planting next year.1700s  Farmers and scientists begin the cross-breeding plants within a species, mixing the genetic makeup of different plants together to select for new desirable traits.Specifically, corn, oats, soy, tomato, potato, rice, wheat and barley that we eat today have been bred to improve pest resistance, yield and taste, for example.1940s and 1950s  Breeders and researchers seek out additional means to introduce genetic variation into the gene pool of plants.One way to generate this variation is to expose seeds to chemicals or irradiation to induce changes in their DNA. This process, called mutagenesis, helps create more genetic variation in seeds. The breeders plant those seeds and look for new, desirable traits. Thousands of plant varieties on the market today have been developed with this technique. More than 2,200 crop varieties have been created with mutagenesis breeding. These crops are not considered GMOs and this technique is not considered genetic engineering. In fact, varieties developed using these techniques are considered to be conventional varieties and are allowed in organic production systems. Mutagenesis produces more random and more significant changes to the genome of plants than techniques such as genetic engineering.Source: Safety of Genetically Engineered Foods: Approaches to Assessing Unintended Health Effects; Committee on Identifying and Assessing Unintended Effects of Genetically Engineered Foods on Human Health (Author), National Research Council (Author); page 451980s  Researchers develop the more precise and controllable methods of genetic engineering to utilize additional sources of variation to create plants with desirable traits.At the same time, genetic engineering is being widely adopted by the medical field to create drugs and therapies for human diseases or other conditions.1990s  The first GMOs are introduced to the marketplace. Genetic engineering or genetic modification means copying a piece of genetic material from one plant (or organism) and using it in another plant. Genetic engineered plants begin to be called GMOs.Read more about the history of genetic modigication in crops:History of Agricultural Biotechnology: How Crop Development has EvolvedThe Gene in Food Revolution

Humans created todays corn cropOver the past century, corn has evolved with the availability of hybrid corn in the 1930s and the planting of GM crops in the mid-1990s. Due to the insect resistance and/or herbicide tolerance of GM corn, more and more of it was planted. Contrary to popular belief, the development and increased usage of GM corn has not changed the physical appearance of corn.What has changed, due to modern plant breeding, is size, consistency, seed performance, yield, the number of ears per stalk, and the position of the ear and the leaves on the stalk. Currently, a plant has only one ear located about waist high (the height of a combine blade), and its leaves grow at a more upright angle to better catch sunrays and rain. A century ago, farmers planted about 8,000 corn plants per acre. Today they plant aboutfour timesas many plants per acre.
