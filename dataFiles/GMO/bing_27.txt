The rules for approving GMO crops and foods need to be overhauled and GMO products should be labeled so we have a choice in what we eat.\nGMOs\nfacebook\ntwitter\ngoogle-plus\nenvelope\nDon\'t let Big Oil and Gas frack our public lands.\nTake Action\nsee more actions\nYouve probably heard news reports claiming GMO food is safe to eat, but the fact is, genetically engineering our food supply carries risks to farmers, workers, the environment, and people living near the fields that are heavily sprayed with the herbicide Roundup, which the World Health Organization calls a probable human carcinogen. Furthermore, the government approves GMO products for the food supply based on data submitted by the very companies that want to sell them.\nMeanwhile, most GMOs are engineered to withstand exposure to powerful weedkillers or produce their own pesticides. Many of these crops are used in animal feed, which fuels factory farms, yet the industry goes to great lengths to greenwash GMO crops.\nThat doesnt sound safe to us. Help protect us all from GMOs by signing this petition for GMO labeling.\nSign the Petition\nWhat are GMOs?\nCompanies like Monsanto create genetically engineered foods, often called genetically modified organisms (GMOs), by using biotechnology techniques to alter seeds or livestocks genetic material. Instead of using the breeding methods that farmers have used for centuries to select for desirable traits, GMO crops and GMO animals may be radically altered to repel pests, withstand herbicides, or grow faster. These changes are patented and help corporations increase their control over the seed supply, but rarely have the best interests of people or the environment in mind.\nThere is No Consensus on GMO Safety\nThe same media reports touting the safety of GMOs ignore a growing portion of the scientific community that says GMOs are far from safe and criticize the weak regulatory system that is designed to approve GMO crops without finding safety problems. The truth is that there is no consensus regarding the safety of GMOsin fact, the evidence shows a serious potential for harm, especially to our environment.\nMany Countries have GMO Labeling. Why Doesn\'t the U.S.?\nPeople in over 60 countries across the world have the ability to choose whether or not they buy GMO foods, because labeling is required. But here in the U.S., where powerful interests lobbyto keep us in the dark about what were eating, we cant tell if our food is GMO.\nIn July 2016, powerful corporations used their influence to pass a bill that we refer to as Monsantos Dream Bill or the DARK (Denying Americans the Right to Know) Act. The new law prohibits states from requiring mandatory genetically engineered food (GMO) labeling. This blocks the GMO labeling law in Vermont that went into effect on July 1, 2016 and blocks any other states from requiring GMO labeling. Industry support pushed the bill through Congress despite widespread public opposition.\nThe DARK Act is a set-back for transparency in our food, but were not done fighting. Food & Water Watch and our allies are still working to require real, clear GMO labeling. You can help by taking action to oppose the merger of Dow and Dupont, two powerful corporations that control too big a share of our food system already. Sign the petition to the Department of Justice and tell them these corporations have too much power already.\nPromoting GMOs Abroad\nThe U.S. government also works on behalf of the industry to promote GMOs around the world, often over the opposition of the public and even governments. Agricultural development is essential for the developing world to foster sustainable economies, enhance food security to combat global hunger and increase resiliency to climate change but thats not what biotechnology companies are promoting. These corporations are putting their own profits ahead of the interests of people at home and abroad.\nGMO Animals?\nThe GMO controversy doesnt end with GMO crops:GMO animals could soon follow. Genetically engineered (GMO) salmon has been approved by the FDAbut the fish could present serious risks to consumer health, animal welfare, wild fish populations, fishing economies and the environment. That\'s all on top of potentially diminishing the nutrition and taste of salmon, one of the most popular and important fish in the American diet.\nMeanwhile, a British company wants to cash in on GMO mosquitos, marketing them as a means of controlling dengue fever. But GMO insects are inherently risky and cannot be truly regulated  not to mention there is a lack of public support and an inability to prove that this science experiment would actually prevent disease transmission.\nFor all these reasons, GMOs are bad for people and the environment. Labeling them is a first step toward protecting ourselves. Take action to label GMOs today.\nTake Action\nRelated LinksLet Me Decide: Label GMOs CampaignBroken DemocracyFive Things Monsanto Doesn\'t Want You to Know About GMOsRelated Downloads\nReport: Genetically Engineered Food\nReport: Genetically Engineered Food\nFact Sheet: GMO Health Risks\nFact Sheet: GMO Health Risks\nIssue Brief: The So-Called Scientific "Consensus" on GMOs\nIssue Brief: The So-Called Scientific "Consensus" on GMOs\nFact Sheet: The Case for GMO Labeling\nFact Sheet: The Case for GMO Labeling\nIssue Brief: GE Salmon\nIssue Brief: GE Salmon\nWhat are Superweeds? 07.1.13Duration:3:18As weeds grow resistant to Monsanto\'s Roundup pesticides, farmers are forced to spray larger quantities and more hazardous types of chemicals to keep these "superweeds" at bay.
