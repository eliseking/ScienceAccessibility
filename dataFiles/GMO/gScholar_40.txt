For comparison similar, measurements were made on laboratory mice. Mus musculus. Whole blood showed a distinctly higher O2 affinity for Heterocephalus at both 30 and 37C. P50 values were 23.3 mm Hg and 33.0mm H gat 37C for Heterocephalus and Mus, respectively, while at 30C P50's were 18.8mm Hg and 24.9 mm Hg, all values at pH (b) 7.4.H values (expressive of the effect of temperature on P50) were 5.8 kcal  mol1 for Heterocephalus and 7.5 kcal  mol1 for Mus. The CO2 Bohr effects () were 0.43 and 0.50 for Heterocephalus at 37 and 30C. Corresponding values for Mus were 0.65 and 0.56. Both species had a Hill's n-value of 2.6. Red cell concentrations of 2,3-DGP were closely similar in the species being 7.3 mmol  L rbc for Heterocephalus and 7.4 mmol  L rbe for Mus.Stripped Heterocephalus Hb had a very high O2 affinity, at pH 7.25. 37C, P50 was 8.0 mm Hg whereas the corresponding value for Mus was 11.3 mm Hg.Addition of DPG to stripped Hb from the two species decreased O2 affinity to the same degree.The high 02 affinity of Heterocephalus blood is viewed as a possible adaptation to its burrowing habits. Its basis is inherent to the hemoglobin molecule itself and not dependent upon cofactor influence or the temperature sensitivity of the O2-Hb binding.KeywordsAdaptation to burrowing; Hemoglobin; Blood O2 affinity; Heterocephalus-Mus; 2,3-DPG; Temperature sensitivityRecommended articlesCiting articles (0)This study was supported by grants from the Danish Natural Science Research Council, the Leverhuime Trust Funds, and the the National Geographic Society.Copyright  1976 Published by Elsevier B.V.Recommended articlesCiting articles\nElsevierAbout ScienceDirectRemote accessShopping cartContact and supportTerms and conditionsPrivacy policyCookies are used by this site.
