Maloiy, D. Hopcraft Animal Physiology Division, East African Veterinary Research Organization, Muguga, P.O. Kabete, Kenya, East AfricaReceived 29 July 1970, Available online 21 March 2003Abstract1.1. In controlled laboratory experiments rectal temperature, cutaneous moisture evaporation and breathing rate were studied in the hartebeest and impala antelope.2.2. At the high air temperatures (4050C), the sweating rate rose to 60 g H2O/m2 per hr and the respiratory rate to over 200/min in both species.3.3. The water balance of the two species was investigated when the antelope were either fully hydrated or dehydrated at the environmental temperatures of 22C or alteration between 22 and 40C at 12-hr intervals. The total body water was estimated in two hartebeest antelope which were allowed to graze freely on the dry pastures of the Athi River Plains.KeywordsAntelopes; hartebeest; impala; thermoregulation; water balance; Alcelaphus buscelaphus; Aepyceros melampusCopyright  1971 Published by Elsevier Inc.\nElsevierAbout ScienceDirectRemote accessShopping cartContact and supportTerms and conditionsPrivacy policyCookies are used by this site.
