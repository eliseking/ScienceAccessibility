DlO2 and VO2max were determined on the same 21 individuals in African mammals spanning a range in body mass from 0.4 to 240 kg. We confirmed earlier findings that DlO2 was proportional to Mb0.99 while VO2max was proportional to Mb0.79. Thus, the ratio of DlO2/VO2max is approximately proportional to Mb0.20. We conclude that large animals require a larger pulmonary diffusing capacity to transfer oxygen at the same rate from air to blood.KeywordsAfrican mammals; Lung morphology; Allometry; Oxygen consumption; Alveolar surface area; Pulmonary diffusing capacityRecommended articlesCiting articles (0)1Present address: Department of Physiology, Harvard School of Public Health, 665 Huntington Avenue, Boston, MA 02115, U.S.A.2Present address: ILRAD, P.O.
