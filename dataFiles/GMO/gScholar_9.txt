Perimetral s/n, Guam, CP 399, Belm, 60060-970 PA, BrazilReceived 6 June 1998, Revised 17 July 1998, Accepted 10 August 1998, Available online 24 May 1999AbstractThe resins and leaves of species of Protium are commonly used by folk medicine. In the present study, we analyse the pharmacological effects of essential oils obtained by steam distillation (leaves and resin) from Protium species. Analysis by gas chromatography (GC) coupled to mass spectrometry and retention indices calculations demonstrate that the resin oil is constituted mainly of monoterpenes and phenylpropanoids: -terpinolene (22%), p-cymene (11%), p-cimen-8-ol (11%), limonene (5%) and dillapiol (16%), whereas sesquiterpenes predominate as the volatile constituents of the leaves. The resin of Protium heptaphyllum (PHP) and leaves of P. strumosum (PS), P. grandifolium (PG), P. lewellyni (PL) and P. hebetatum (PHT) were screened for anti-inflammatory activity by the use of mouse pleurisy model induced by zymosan (500 g/cavity) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (250 ng/cavity), for antinociceptive effect (by means of preventing mice abdominal writhings), as well as NO production from stimulated macrophages and proliferation of neoplasic cell lines: Neuro-2a (mouse neuroblastoma), SP2/0 (mouse plasmocytoma) and J774 (mouse monocytic cell line). The oils from PHP, PS and PL were able to inhibit protein extravasation but no sample inhibited total or differential leucocyte counts after administrating p.o. (100 mg/kg) 1 h before stimulation with zymosan. The oils from PG, PL and PHT inhibited neutrophil accumulation whereas PHP and specially PL inhibited LPS-induced eosinophil accumulation in mouse pleural cavity. PHT was also able to inhibit mononuclear cells accumulation. Antinociceptive effect was not observed, when animals received oral administration of the essential oils (100 mg/kg). In vitro treatment with essential oils (100 g/well) changed the NO production from stimulated mouse macrophages. PHP inhibited in 74% and PS in 46% the LPS-induced NO production. In contrast, treatment with PL was able to increase in 49% the NO production. Cell lines proliferation was affected by the oils assayed in the range of 60100% for Neuro-2a, 6595% for SP2/0 and 7090% for J774. Taken together these results showed that essential oils could be useful as efficient pharmacological tools.KeywordsBurseraceae; Protium; Essential oil; Anti-inflammatory effect; Antinociceptive effect; Anti-neoplasic effect; NO productionCorresponding author.
