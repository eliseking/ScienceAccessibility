Allometric equations based on body mass have been calculated for muscle masses, fibre lengths and moment arms and the thickness of a tendon, in several groups of mammals. Departures from geometric similarity in mammals in general (excluding bipedal hoppers) are noted and discussed. Differences between primates; fissipedes, bovids and bipedal hoppers are also demonstrated.\nGet access to the full text of this article\nAncillaryArticle InformationDOI10.1111/j.1469-7998.1981.tb04600.xView/save citationFormat AvailableFull text: PDF\nRequest Permissions\nPublication HistoryIssue online: 31 December 2010Version of record online: 31 December 2010Accepted 9 December 1980Related content\nArticles related to the one you are viewingPlease enable Javascript to view the related content of this article.Citing Literature\nNumber of times cited: 831Meng Chen, Gregory P.
