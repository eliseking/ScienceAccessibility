Stakeholder input wanted: survey on research needs for assessing GMO
impacts
Shaping the Future of GMO Research
Stakeholder with interests in the risk and/or benefit assessment of
Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs) are invited to take part in an online
survey.
The aim of this survey is to identify which research needs should be
prioritised, thereby contributing to the commissioning of research on the
health, environment and economic impacts of GMOs.
The survey will close on 15th July 2015.

GMO Database
Genetically Modified Food and Feed: Authorization in the EU.
Many genetically modified plants have already been approved for use in food and feed in the EU. Additional applications are awaiting decisions.
This database contains information about every genetically modified plant that has been approved or is awaiting approval in the EU. Information on the food and feed produced from the respective GM plant is also available.
