Inclusion of 25% ethanol in the extraction medium increased the volume of recovered extract from heat-processed cassava products, eliminated the need for centrifugation and did not interfere with any aspect of the assay. Greater cyanohydrin recovery was noted and the calculation for cyanogen contents was changed to take into account the total extract volume. The separate assay of the three cyanogens (glucosides, cyanohydrins and free cyanide) was achieved by buffering aliquots of the extract followed by appropriate treatment. The importance of assaying for free cyanide (HCN) at pH 4 was demonstrated. Above this pH, cyanohydrin degradation also produces free cyanide, giving rise to misleading values. The efficiency of the extraction medium in recovering added linamarin and cyanohydrin from cassava foods was determined. Recoveries of cyanohydrin were improved using the ethanol/acid medium.The stability of the cyanogens in the ethanol/acid extraction medium was tested at ambient and refrigeration temperatures. Over a two-month period, refrigerated extracts showed acceptable variation as compared with normal variation within the assay (5%) for total and non-glycosidic cyanogens but the levels of free cyanide showed heavy losses (1556% lost). Since the relative toxicities of the three cyanogens have yet to be ascertained, the relative amount of each cyanogen may be important when assessing the safety of cassava products.\nGet access to the full text of this article\nAncillaryArticle InformationDOI10.1002/jsfa.2740560304View/save citationFormat AvailableFull text: PDFCopyright  1991 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd\nRequest Permissions\nKeywordscassava; cyanide assay; linamarin; cyanohydrin; linamarasePublication HistoryIssue online: 19 September 2006Version of record online: 19 September 2006Manuscript Accepted: 18 April 1991Manuscript Revised: 30 January 1991Manuscript Received: 12 July 1990Related content\nArticles related to the one you are viewingPlease enable Javascript to view the related content of this article.Citing Literature\nNumber of times cited: 561Sutisa Khempaka, Ruthairat Thongkratok, Supattra Okrathok, Wittawat Molee, An Evaluation of Cassava Pulp Feedstuff Fermented with A. oryzae, on Growth Performance, Nutrient Digestibility and Carcass Quality of Broilers, The Journal of Poultry Science, 2014, 51, 1, 71CrossRef2Lucas Daniel Tivana, Jose Da Cruz Francisco, Felix Zelder, Bjorn Bergensthl, Petr Dejmek, Straightforward rapid spectrophotometric quantification of total cyanogenic glycosides in fresh and processed cassava products, Food Chemistry, 2014, 158, 20CrossRef3Gerard M.
