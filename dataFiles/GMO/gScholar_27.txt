It discusses the results with respect to the principle of symmorphosis, i.e. of morphogenesis adapted to functional needs. We find that the accumulated evidence supports this principle at all organizational levels considered, although the models used for structure-function correlation need further refinement.KeywordsAllometry; Mitochondrial volume; Capillary length; Muscles; Lung's diffusing capacity; Oxygen consumptionRecommended articlesCiting articles (0)1Present address: Department of Physiology, Harvard School of Public Health, 665 Huntington Avenue, Boston, MA 02115, U.S.A.2Present address: Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, University of Nairobi, P.O.
