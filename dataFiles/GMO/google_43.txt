The (Anti) GMO Debate
Or how one student decided to respond tothepro-GMO propaganda at Cornell University
By Robert Schooler at www.gmowtf.com
My name is Robert, and I am a Cornell University undergraduate student. However, Im not sure if I want to be one any more. Allow me to explain.
Cornell, as an institution, appears to be complicit in a shocking amount of ecologically destructive, academically unethical, and scientifically deceitful behavior.
Perhaps the most potent example isCornells deep ties to industrial GMO agriculture, and the affiliated corporations such asMonsanto. Id like to share how I became aware of this troubling state of affairs.

BREAKING NEWS: a new peer reviewed study of the Ag-Biotech industrys so called long term safety studies has found them to besignificantly inaccurate or flawed and lacking in proof ofsafety.
And these are just short-term animal feeding studies because nearly two decades after genetic engineered ingredientshave been present in the majority of processed foods found in your grocery store, NO long term human health studies haveever been performed.
Why is no research being done on the potential human health risks of GMOs? The ag-bio companies wont let it happen.

New evidence points to glyphosate, the active ingredient in Monsantos RoundUp weedkiller, as the culprit in the rise of gluten intolerance, celiac disease and irritable bowel syndrome.
No, this isnt coming from Monsantos test plots of wheat genetically engineered to resist RoundUp (yet). This is coming from a standard practice used on the vast majority of non-organic wheat grown in the United States and other countries

In 2010, Dr. E. Ann Clark, a retired Associate Professor from theUniversity of Guelphs Plant Agriculture Department in Ontario, Canada, wrote the following paper demonstrating the logic behind organic agriculture as the best choice in a post-oil future.
Think about it: the current agri-food system was designed around the use of fossil fuelsto bring seeds and fertilizers to the farm, to prepare the soil, to seed, fertilize, harvest and deliver the raw crop to central distribution points, to transport the crop to processors / manufacturers, and then to transport the processed food or grain back to grocery stores and end users.
Can this reliance on oil at every step of the agricultural processremain sustainable long-term?
