The aim of this study was to obtain and evaluate the electrical conductivity of polyaniline doped with dodecylbenzenesulfonic acid (PAni.DBSA)/polyurethane thermoplastic (TPU) blends. The PAni.DBSA was synthesized from DBSA-aniline (DBSAn) salt through an emulsion polymerization in tetrahydrofurane (THF) or in the presence of polyurethane thermoplastic solution, resulting in pure PAni.DBSA or PAni.DBSA/TPU blends. Blends of PAni.DBSA/TPU were also prepared through casting, at room temperature, after dissolving both components in THF as a common solvent. The insulatorconductor transition was very sharp and the percolation threshold was lower than 2.7wt% of PAni.DBSA. The electrical conductivity of PAni.DBSA/TPU blends, prepared by both methods, reached maximum values at a PAni.DBSA concentration of 40wt%, close to the value observed for the undiluted conducting polymer. However, for a PAni.DBSA content lower than 30wt%, the electrical conductivity was dependent on the blend preparation method. Blends were characterized by infrared spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis (TG) and optical microscopy. The electrical conducting characteristics of the PAni.DBSA/TPU blends prepared using different procedures indicate a high potential for their successful application in electrical processes.KeywordsPolyurethane thermoplastic elastomer; Polyaniline; Electrical conductivityCorresponding author.
