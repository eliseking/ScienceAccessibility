A female ostrich has been dissected and the principal bones, muscles and tendons in a leg have been measured. It is calculated that stresses up to 240 kN m2 and 40 MN m2, respectively, act in the digital flexor muscles and their tendons during running. Tensile and compressive stresses up to about 70MNm2 and 110 MNm2 act in the tibiotarsus. A large proportion of the energy which would otherwise be required for running is probably saved by elastic storage in tendons. Comparisons are made with the legs of flying birds and of antelopes.\nGet access to the full text of this article\nAncillaryArticle InformationDOI10.1111/j.1469-7998.1979.tb03941.xView/save citationFormat AvailableFull text: PDF\nRequest Permissions\nPublication HistoryIssue online: 20 August 2009Version of record online: 20 August 2009Accepted 9 May 1978Related content\nArticles related to the one you are viewingPlease enable Javascript to view the related content of this article.Citing Literature\nNumber of times cited: 381Bin Wang, Wen Yang, Joanna McKittrick, Marc Andr Meyers, Keratin: Structure, mechanical properties, occurrence in biological organisms, and efforts at bioinspiration, Progress in Materials Science, 2016, 76, 229CrossRef2John R.
