About the Film
GMO OMG director and concerned father Jeremy Seifert is in search of answers. How do GMOs affect our children, the health of our planet, and our freedom of choice? And perhaps the ultimate question, which Seifert tests himself: is it even possible to reject the food system currently in place, or have we lost something we cant gain back? These and other questions take Seifert on a journey from his familys table to Haiti, Paris, Norway, and the lobby of agra-giant Monsanto, from which he is unceremoniously ejected.
Along the way we gain insight into a question that is of growing concern to citizens the world over: what's on your plate?
