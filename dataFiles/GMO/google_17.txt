What are GMOs?
If youve eaten anything today, chances are youve snacked on GMOs. GMO
stands for genetically modified organism. Genetically modified (GM) foods are
made from soy, corn, or other crops grown from seeds with genetically
engineered DNA.
According to the U.S.
Department of Agriculture (USDA), GM seeds are used to plant more than 90
percent of corn, soybeans, and cotton grown in the United States. Unless you
consciously avoid them, GM foods likely find their way into many of your snacks
and meals.
Some people believe GM foods are safe, healthy, and sustainable, while
others claim the opposite. Read on to learn about the pros and cons  and what
the research says.
Pros of GM foods
Scientists genetically engineer seeds for many reasons. For example, they
sometimes make changes designed to increase a plants:
resistance to insectstolerance to herbicidestolerance for heat, cold, or droughtcrop yield
They also engineer seeds to give GM foods stronger colors, increase their
shelf life, or eliminate seeds. Thats why we can buy seedless watermelons and
grapes. Some GM foods also have been engineered to have higher levels of specific
nutrients, such as protein, calcium, or folate.
Proponents of GM food contend that genetic engineering can help us find sustainable
ways to feed people. Specifically, in countries that lack access to nutrient-rich
foods. The heartiness of some GM crops makes it so they can grow in marginal
environments. The longer shelf life of some GM foods allows them to be shipped
to remote areas.
Potential cons of GM foods
On the other hand, some people wonder if GM foods are safe and healthy to
eat. Genetic engineering is a relatively new development. As a result, research
on the long-term health effects of GM foods is limited.
GM foods have to meet the same safety requirements as foods grown from
non-GM seeds. But critics suggest theres more to be concerned about. Some
people worry that GM foods may be linked to allergies, antibiotic resistance,
or cancer. Others suggest these concerns are unfounded. Heres what the
research says.
Allergies
Food allergies are a growing problem in the United States. According to the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC), food allergies in children under 18 years of
age have increased; from 3.4 percent between 1997 and 1999 to 5.1 percent between
2009 and 2011.
Some people believe that spike is linked to GM foods. But theres no
evidence that GM foods in general are more likely to trigger allergic reactions
than non-GM foods, according to a study from Harvard
University.
Others raise concerns about the transfer of specific proteins from one plant
to another in genetic engineering. Proteins found in a relatively small number
of foods cause most allergic reactions. Tree nuts are one of the most common
triggers.
In the mid-1990s, researchers examined a strain of GM soybean that was
engineered to contain protein from Brazil nuts. According to their report in
the New
England Journal of Medicine, the soybeans triggered allergic reactions in
people with Brazil nut allergy. Those soybeans never entered the market and
arent sold to consumers.
The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and World
Health Organization (WHO) have since established protocols for GM foods. They
require GM foods to be tested for their ability to cause allergic reactions.
According to the Mayo
Clinic, none of the GM foods that are currently on the market have been
found to have allergenic effects.
Antibiotic resistance
Antibiotic-resistant bacteria can resist antibiotics, making them hard to
kill. According to the CDC,
antibiotic-resistant germs infect two million people each year. Those
infections kill at least 23,000 people per year.
Scientists often modify seeds using antibiotic-resistant genes in the
genetic engineering process. Some people wonder if theres a link between these
GM foods and rising rates of antibiotic resistant bacteria. No studies have confirmed
this claim, but more research is needed.
Cancer
In 2013, the journal Food
and Chemical Toxicology retracted a paper that linked the herbicide Roundup
and Roundup-tolerant GM corn to cancer and premature death in rats. Due to
concerns about the paper, the journals editor reviewed the researchers raw
data and the peer-review process. They found the researchers had used too few rats,
the specific strain of rats was prone to cancer, and the results were
inconclusive.
Since then, the paper has been republished in another journal, Environmental Sciences Europe. The controversy surrounding the studys findings has
continued.
According to the American
Cancer Society, more research is needed to assess the potential long-term
health effects of GM foods.
How can you tell if youre buying GM food?
The European
Commission requires GM food products in Europe to be labeled as such. But
in the United States, no federal mandate exists for labeling GM foods. As a
result, it can be hard to know if youre buying and eating GM foods.
If you decide to avoid GM foods, look for products that are USDA
certified organic. Certified organic foods are grown and handled without
the use of GMOs.
