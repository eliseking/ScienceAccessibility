This event is followed by an exodus of specific lymphocytes, which home to various effector sites such as the lamina propria regions and glands. These responses are regulated by T cells and cytokines and lead to plasma cell differentiation and subsequent production of S-IgA antibodies in external secretions. This knowledge has led to practical approaches for vaccine construction and delivery into mucosal inductive sites in an effort to elicit host protection at mucosal surfaces where the infection actually occurs.KeywordsMucosal; secretory IgA; lamina propria; Peyer's patches; lymphocytesTo whom correspondence should be addressed.Copyright  1992 Published by Elsevier Ltd.\nElsevierAbout ScienceDirectRemote accessShopping cartContact and supportTerms and conditionsPrivacy policyCookies are used by this site.
