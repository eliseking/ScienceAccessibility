PaperThe vaccine adverse event reporting system (VAERS)Robert T. Chen, , Suresh C. Rastogi, John R. Mullen, Scott W. Hayes, Stephen L. Cochi, Jerome A. Donlon, Steven G. Wassilak National Immunization Program, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, Food and Drug Administration Rockville, MD USAReceived 8 April 1993, Revised 9 August 1993, Accepted 9 August 1993, Available online 13 November 2002AbstractImmunizations against most vaccine-preventable diseases will be needed indefinitely unless the disease is eradicated. Public acceptance of immunizations may be threatened as vaccine coverage increases and disease decreases, however, due to the increase in both causally and coincidentally related vaccine adverse events. The post-marketing surveillance for such events in the USA in response to the mandatory reporting requirements of the National Childhood Injury Act of 1986. While V AERS has many methodological limitations intrinsic to such systems, it can play an important role in helping to monitor vaccine safety and maintain public confidence in immunizations.KeywordsVaccination; immunization; adverse reactions; product surveillance; postmarketingTo whom correspondence should be addressed.Copyright  1994 Published by Elsevier Ltd.
