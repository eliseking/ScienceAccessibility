It spreads through the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes. Measles starts with fever. Soon after, it causes a cough, runny nose, and red eyes. Then a rash of tiny, red spots breaks out. It starts at the head and spreads to the rest of the body.\nMeasles can be prevented with MMR vaccine. The vaccine protects against three diseases: measles, mumps, and rubella. CDC recommends children get two doses of MMR vaccine, starting with the first dose at 12 through 15 months of age, and the second dose at 4 through 6 years of age. Teens and adults should also be up to date on their MMR vaccination.\nThe MMR vaccine is very safe and effective. Two doses of MMR vaccine are about 97% effective at preventing measles; one dose is about 93% effective.\nChildren may also get MMRV vaccine, which protects against measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella (chickenpox). This vaccine is only licensed for use in children who are 12 months through 12 years of age.\nBefore the measles vaccination program started in 1963, an estimated 3 to 4 million people got measles each year in the United States. Of these, approximately 500,000 cases were reported each year to CDC; of these, 400 to 500 died, 48,000 were hospitalized, and 1,000 developed encephalitis (brain swelling) from measles. Since then, widespread use of measles vaccine has led to a greater than 99% reduction in measles cases compared with the pre-vaccine era. However, measles is still common in other countries. Unvaccinated people continue to get measles while abroad and bring the disease into the United States and spread it to others.\nCDC recommends that children get two doses of MMR vaccine:\nthe first dose at 12 through 15 months of age, and\nthe second dose at 4 through 6 years of age.\nTeens and adults should also be up to date on MMR vaccinations.\nWhat Everyone Should Know\nBasic information for people interested in the vaccine...\nInformation for Healthcare Professionals\nVaccine recommendations and contraindications; composition, dosage, and administration; handling and storage...\nRelated Links\nMeasles and Rubella Initiative\nWorld Health Organization\nPan American Health Organization\nFile Formats Help:How do I view different file formats (PDF, DOC, PPT, MPEG) on this site?\nAdobe PDF file\nMicrosoft PowerPoint file\nMicrosoft Word file\nMicrosoft Excel file\nAudio/Video file\nApple Quicktime file\nRealPlayer file\nText file\nZip Archive file\nSAS file\nePub file\nRIS file\nPage last reviewed: November 3, 2014\nPage last updated: November 22, 2016\nContent source:\nNational Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, Division of Viral Diseases\nEmail\nRecommend\nTweet\nYouTube\nInstagram\nListen\nWatch\nRSS\nABOUT\nAbout CDC\nJobs\nFunding\nLEGAL\nPolicies\nPrivacy\nFOIA\nNo Fear Act\nOIG\n1600 Clifton Road\nAtlanta,\nGA\n30329-4027\nUSA\n800-CDC-INFO (800-232-4636),\nTTY: 888-232-6348\nEmail CDC-INFO\nU.S. Department of Health & Human Services\nHHS/Open\nUSA.gov\nTop'
