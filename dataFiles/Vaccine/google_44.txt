It focuses on the role of military and medical authority in the introduction of vaccines and looks at why some parents have resisted this authority. Political and social intrigue have often accompanied vaccinationfrom the divisive introduction of smallpox inoculation in colonial Boston to the 9,000 lawsuits recently filed by parents convinced that vaccines caused their children\'s autism. With narrative grace and investigative journalism, Arthur Allen reveals a history illuminated by hope and shrouded by controversy, and he sheds new light on changing notions of health, risk, and the common good.\nRead more\nRead less\nSee all buying options\nVaccine: The Controversial Story of Medicine\'s Greatest Lifesaver\n$18.82\nFree Shipping for Prime Members |\nFast, FREE Shipping with Amazon Prime\nOnly 1 left in stock (more on the way).\nShips from and sold by Amazon.com.\nGift-wrap available.\nclick to open popover\nFrequently Bought Together\n+\nTotal price: $59.77\nAdd both to Cart\nAdd both to List\nOne of these items ships sooner than the other.

Washington-based journalist Allen explores in depth this dark horse of medicine from the first instances of doctors saving patients from smallpox by infecting them with it to the current controversy over vaccinating preteen girls against the sexually transmitted virus that causes cervical cancer. One thing becomes very clear: fear of vaccination is not a recent problem. In colonial America, inoculations against smallpox were seen by many as a means of deflecting the will of God. In the 20th century, the triumphs of the Salk polio vaccine and the eradication of smallpox may actually have led to current antivaccination movements: "as infectious diseases disappeared, in part thanks to vaccines, the risks of vaccination itself were thrown into relief." Allen\'s comprehensive, often unexpected and intelligently told history illuminates the complexity of a public health policy that may put the individual at risk but will save the community. This book leaves the reader with a sense of awe at all that vaccination has accomplished and trepidation over the future of the vaccine industry. 16 pages of illus. (Jan.)

Allen undertakes a ponderous mission indeed because there has been so much controversy, most recently regarding an alleged link between autism and a vaccine, and disagreement over the efficacy of various vaccines. A 2005 study found little difference in fatality rates between elderly flu shot recipients and those who didn\'t get the shots, and then there\'s the whole discussion about how much social responsibility the individual must bear when getting a vaccination that puts the recipient at risk of unwanted side effects but also helps protect the community from an epidemic. Thorny issues all, which Allen deftly maneuvers as he wrangles myriad aspects of a very complicated issue into a comprehensible text. Donna ChavezCopyright  American Library Association.

I think Allen portrayed anti-vaccinating parents somewhat unfairly during the whooping cough epidemic, but perhaps his account was accurate based on what he experienced. More interesting was the history and the arguments for/against vaccines that have been brought up over the past 2+ centuries since variolation was in practice to protect against smallpox. A lot of the arguments from the early days have persisted, and he fairly points out, with skepticism, how some concerns just don\'t make much sense. One thing I was pleased with is that, even though this book seeems to come out in favor of vaccines overall, he didn\'t shy away from some of the serious issues with vaccines: such as SV40 in polio vaccine in the 60\'s which was found to cause tumors, and Hepatitis B being introduced during the course of vaccination because of the use of human blood serum and the routine re-use of needles for vaccinating in low-resource areas. A great book for anyone who wants a fair look at vaccine history. The only con is that it could get a bit dry during long discussions of the process of creating some vaccines and the politics involved.Read more0Comment|Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse5.0 out of 5 starsA Thoughtful Critique of an Important SubjectByS. Herlihyon August 26, 2012Format: Hardcover|Verified PurchaseThis book is a highly readeable and intriguing look at an important subject. Mr. Allen writes well and gives us insights into the thought process of the anti-vax movement. He also walks the reader through the long and facinating history of the development of vaccines. A must for any parent or interested onlooker curious about this subject.Other good books out there can also help readers understand this issue including the following one that Mr. Allen praised:Your Baby\'s Best Shot: Why Vaccines Are Safe and Save LivesRead more0Comment|Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse5.0 out of 5 starsAn incredible account.

Zimeton March 8, 2007Format: Hardcover|Verified PurchaseThe book is very well-written and extensively researched.\nThe information provided is accurate and balanced.\nMr. Allen does not shy away from criticizing the public health establishment when it refused, for instance, to recognize dangers associated with small pox vaccine during the early days of vaccination.\nAt the same time, he clearly recognizes and accurately gives credit to vaccination for the many health benefits provided by vaccines.By the way, there are not "mounting problems with the current vaccination schedule" and mercury was removed from childhood vaccines several years ago.Read more0Comment|\n6 people found this helpful.\nWas this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse5.0 out of 5 starsVery enjoyable with an important messageByDr. Bon January 29, 2007Format: Hardcover|Verified PurchaseThis will appeal to many people, from history buffs to health professionals and those of us who also love a good story. Myself, I always enjoy the human behavior aspect to how things came to be in our society, and the story of vaccination is terrific. Aside from the fun aspect of this book, Mr. Allen manages to write compassionately about the real people who have believed that their children\'s autism was caused by vaccines. There has been so much propaganda and spurious argumentation around this issue (particularly by people like Don Imus--he should be ashamed of himself), which has unfortunately lead many parents of children with autism to believe that vaccination caused their child\'s disability. I hope very much that Mr. Allen\'s work will help shine the light of reason on that sad situation.Read more88 comments|\n27 people found this helpful.\nWas this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuseSee all verified purchase reviews (newest first)Write a customer review\nMost Recent Customer Reviews5.0 out of 5 starsTells an important story, vaccines have saved hundreds of millions of livesThe vaccine controversy would naturally bring out negative reviewers for this book.
