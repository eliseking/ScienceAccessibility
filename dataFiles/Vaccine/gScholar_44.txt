MeNZB, administered in a three-dose regimen, was well tolerated and induced a seroresponse, defined as a four-fold rise (titre 8) in serum bactericidal antibodies against the vaccine strain 46 weeks after the third vaccination, in 96% (95% confidence interval (CI): 79100%) of adults, 76% (95% CI: 7280%) of children, 75% (95% CI: 6980%) of toddlers and 74% (95% CI: 6780%) of infants receiving MeNZB. In conclusion, these findings suggest that MeNZB is safe and is likely to confer protection against systemic group B meningococcal disease caused by the epidemic strain.KeywordsSerum bactericidal assay (SBA); Outer membrane vesicle (OMV) vaccine; Epidemic controlCorresponding author.
