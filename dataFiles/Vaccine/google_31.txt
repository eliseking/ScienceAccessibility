This vaccine is not widely used in the United States, but it is often given to infants and small children in other countries where TB is common. BCG does not always protect people from getting TB.\nBCG Recommendations\nIn the United States, BCG should be considered for only very select people who meet specific criteria and in consultation with a TB expert. Health care providers who are considering BCG vaccination for their patients are encouraged to discuss this intervention with the TB control program in their area.\nChildren\nBCG vaccination should only be considered for children who have a negative TB test and who are continually exposed, and cannot be separated from adults who\nAre untreated or ineffectively treated for TB disease, and the child cannot be given long-term primary preventive treatment for TB infection; or\nHave TB disease caused by strains resistant to isoniazid and rifampin.\nHealth Care Workers\nBCG vaccination of health care workers should be considered on an individual basis in settings in which\nA high percentage of TB patients are infected with TB strains resistant to both isoniazid and rifampin;\nThere is ongoing transmission of drug-resistant TB strains to health care workers and subsequent infection is likely; or\nComprehensive TB infection-control precautions have been implemented, but have not been successful.\nHealth care workers considered for BCG vaccination should be counseled regarding the risks and benefits associated with both BCG vaccination and treatment of latent TB infection.\nTesting for TB in BCG-Vaccinated People\nMany people born outside of the United States have been BCG-vaccinated.\nPeople who were previously vaccinated with BCG may receive a TB skin test to test for TB infection. Vaccination with BCG may cause a positive reaction to a TB skin test. A positive reaction to a TB skin test may be due to the BCG vaccine itself or due to infection with TB bacteria.\nTB blood tests (IGRAs), unlike the TB skin test, are not affected by prior BCG vaccination and are not expected to give a false-positive result in people who have received BCG.\nFor children under the age of five, the TB skin test is preferred over TB blood tests.\nA positive TB skin test or TB blood test only tells that a person has been infected with TB bacteria. It does not tell whether the person has latent TB infection or has progressed to TB disease. Other tests, such as a chest x-ray and a sample of sputum, are needed to see whether the person has TB disease.\nLearn about Testing and Diagnosis.\nRelated Links\nFor Patients\nQuestions and Answers About TB\nBCG Vaccine (Fact sheet)\nFor Health Care Providers\nVaccine and Immunization Guidelines\nTesting and Diagnosis Guidelines\nThe BCG World Atlas: A Database of Global BCG Vaccination Policies and Practices\nLanguage:English\nEspaol (Spanish)\nFile Formats Help:How do I view different file formats (PDF, DOC, PPT, MPEG) on this site?\nAdobe PDF file\nMicrosoft PowerPoint file\nMicrosoft Word file\nMicrosoft Excel file\nAudio/Video file\nApple Quicktime file\nRealPlayer file\nText file\nZip Archive file\nSAS file\nePub file\nRIS file\nPage last reviewed: March 15, 2016\nPage last updated: March 15, 2016\nContent source:\nDivision of Tuberculosis Elimination\nEmail\nRecommend\nTweet\nYouTube\nInstagram\nListen\nWatch\nRSS\nABOUT\nAbout CDC\nJobs\nFunding\nLEGAL\nPolicies\nPrivacy\nFOIA\nNo Fear Act\nOIG\n1600 Clifton Road\nAtlanta,\nGA\n30329-4027\nUSA\n800-CDC-INFO (800-232-4636),\nTTY: 888-232-6348\nEmail CDC-INFO\nU.S. Department of Health & Human Services\nHHS/Open\nUSA.gov\nTop'
