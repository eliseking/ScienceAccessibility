Public health officials have long struggled to bring adults in the U.S. up to date on vaccines.\n"Vaccinations are not just for kids," Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, told ABC News. "There are any number of vaccines that are targeted to adults. We can do a much better job to deliver these vaccines."\nOfficials from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\'s advisory committee on immunization practices released new recommendations for hepatitis B, influenza and HPV vaccines today as part of its annual vaccination guidelines.\nDrug Overdose Deaths Drive Increase in Number of Organ Donations\nCanada Approves Prescription Heroin to Combat Opioid Crisis\nWhat the Future Holds for Youngest Double Hand Transplant Patient\nAmong the possible reasons the report cited for low vaccination coverage among adults in the U.S. were "competing priorities with management of patients\' acute and chronic health conditions, lower prioritization of immunization for adults compared with other preventive services, and financial barriers to providing vaccination services to adults."\nNot surprisingly, adults who had health insurance were more likely to be up to date on their vaccination coverage. Immunization rates for people with health insurance were two to five times those for people without health insurance.\nThe CDC found that another barrier to vaccine coverage could be physicians themselves. It reported that approximately 25 percent of internists felt age-based vaccination recommendations for adults were difficult to follow. Additionally, 29 percent reported that vaccine recommendations based on medical condition were difficult to follow.\nThe advisory committee recommends using amplifiers  including patient reminders, recalling patients who have missing vaccines and having alerts in electronic medical records  to improve immunization coverage for adults.\nSchaffner said he hoped additional funding to help adults afford vaccinations, especially if they don\'t have health insurance, could be implemented on a national level in order to improve vaccination rates.\n"The population, with the exception of the influenza vaccine, doesn\'t think about vaccines for adults very often," he said. "These are important to you, and most of these are communicable diseases."\nAmong the changes to the CDC\'s recommendations this year are updates on administering the hepatitis B, HPV and flu vaccines. For the HPV vaccine, the CDC now recommends only two doses five months apart, if started before age 15. If the vaccination is started after age 15, then three doses are recommended.\nTo protect against meningitis, healthy adults are now recommended to have only two  not three  doses of the serotype B meningitis vaccine. However, three doses are recommended in cases of meningitis outbreaks or if a person is at increased risk for contracting the disease.\nFor those with chronic liver disease or liver enzymes that are at worrying levels, the CDC now recommends receiving the hepatitis B vaccine to protect the liver from infection.\nFinally, the CDC recommends using the common injection flu vaccine, not the nasal mist, which was found to be less effective in studies.\n0 Shares\nEmail\nStar\nComments\n"\nCDC Issues New Vaccine Guidelines for Adults\n"\nDOJ Cites \'National Security\' in Call to Reinstate Immigration Order\n"\nFacebook Takes Search Warrant Challenge to Top Court\n"\nSenate Democrats Begin Protests Against Trump Education Secretary Pick\n"\nPresident Trump Not Welcome in UK Parliament, Speaker Says\n"\nAmnesty: At Least 13,000 Hanged in Syrian Prison Since 2011\n"\nDakota Access Pipeline Decision Could Come This Week: Army Corps of Engineers\n"\nAppeals Court Weighs Trump Ban as Travelers Arrive to Tears\n"\nTeen Admits Killing Florida Woman in London Knife Rampage\n"\nIsrael Passes Law Legalizing Thousands of Settlement Homes\n"\nMerkel to Seek Common Ground With Trump \'Wherever Possible\'\nKansas Woman Runs 1st Full Mile Since Leg Amputation\n"\nLife in Limbo: Diary of a Syrian Mom Affected by Travel Ban\n"\nWith Travel Ban on Hold, Iraqi Family Arrives in 2nd Attempt to Reach US\n"\nWoman Captive for Decade Hopes New TV Role Helps the Missing\n"\nNot Guilty Plea From Man Who Shot Ex-NFL Player McKnight\n"\nSean Spicer Reacts to Melissa McCarthy \'SNL\' Impression\n"\nScarlett Johansson Discusses Hollywood Wage Gap, Sexism'
