The virus can cause severe watery diarrhea, vomiting, fever, and abdominal pain. Children who get rotavirus disease can become dehydrated and may need to be hospitalized.\nRotavirus vaccine is the best way to protect your child against rotavirus illness. Most children (about 9 out of 10) who get the vaccine will be protected from severe rotavirus illness. While about 7 out of 10 children will be protected from rotavirus illness.\nTwo rotavirus vaccines are currently licensed for use in infants in the United States:\nRotaTeq (RV5) is given in 3 doses at ages 2 months, 4 months, and 6 months\nRotarix (RV1) is given in 2 doses at ages 2 months and 4 months\nBoth vaccines are given by mouth (orally), not by a shot. The first dose of either vaccine is most effective if it is given before a child is 15 weeks of age. Also, children should receive all doses of rotavirus vaccine before they turn 8 months old.\nWhat Everyone Should Know\nVaccine basics for parents of infants and children\nInformation for Health Care Professionals\nVaccine recommendations and contraindications; composition, dosage, and administration; handling and storage\nRelated Pages\nRotavirus Vaccine Information Sheet (VIS)\nMultiple Vaccine VIS (rotavirus, DTaP, Hib, Hepatitis B, polio, and PCV 13)\nRotavirus Information on vaccines.gov\nCDC Rotavirus Disease Website\nRotavirus Vaccine Safety\nCDC Feature: Protect Your Child against Severe Rotavirus\nRotavirus Fact Sheet\nIn English [2 pages]\nEn Espaol\nRotavirus: I Just Wish We Had Known\nA mother's true story about how her twin babies got very sick with rotavirus illness\nChild Immunization Schedule\nRelated Links\nWorld Health Organization\nPATH's Rotavirus Vaccine Program\nAmerican Academy of Pediatrics\nFile Formats Help:How do I view different file formats (PDF, DOC, PPT, MPEG) on this site?\nAdobe PDF file\nMicrosoft PowerPoint file\nMicrosoft Word file\nMicrosoft Excel file\nAudio/Video file\nApple Quicktime file\nRealPlayer file\nText file\nZip Archive file\nSAS file\nePub file\nRIS file\nPage last reviewed: August 12, 2016\nPage last updated: August 12, 2016\nContent source:\nNational Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, Division of Viral Diseases\nEmail\nRecommend\nTweet\nYouTube\nInstagram\nListen\nWatch\nRSS\nABOUT\nAbout CDC\nJobs\nFunding\nLEGAL\nPolicies\nPrivacy\nFOIA\nNo Fear Act\nOIG\n1600 Clifton Road\nAtlanta,\nGA\n30329-4027\nUSA\n800-CDC-INFO (800-232-4636),\nTTY: 888-232-6348\nEmail CDC-INFO\nU.S. Department of Health & Human Services\nHHS/Open\nUSA.gov\nTop"
