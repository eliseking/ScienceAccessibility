When the final article is assigned to volumes/issues of the publication, the Article in Press version will be removed and the final version will appear in the associated published volumes/issues of the publication. The date an article was first made available online will be carried over. Please be aware that, although Articles in Press do not have all bibliographic details available yet, they can already be cited using the year of online publication and the DOI , as follows: author(s), article title, Publication (year), DOI.\nPlease consult the journal's reference style for the exact appearance of these elements, abbreviation of journal names and use of punctuation.\nThere are three types of Articles in Press:\nAccepted manuscripts: articles that have been peer reviewed and accepted for publication by the Editorial Board. They have not yet been copy edited and/or formatted in the publication house style, and may not yet have full ScienceDirect functionality, e.g., supplementary files may still need to be added, links to references may not resolve yet etc.\nUncorrected proofs: articles that have been copy edited and formatted, but have not been finalized yet. They still need to be proof-read and corrected by the author(s) and the text could still change before final publication.\nCorrected proofs: articles that contain the authors' corrections. Final citation details, e.g. volume and/or issue number, publication year and page numbers, still need to be added and the text might change before final publication.\nArticles 1 - 62\nArticles 1 - 62\n< Previous vol/iss\nNo next vol/iss\nElsevierAbout ScienceDirectRemote accessShopping cartContact and supportTerms and conditionsPrivacy policyCookies are used by this site.
