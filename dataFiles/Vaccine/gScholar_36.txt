A total of 40 811 volunteers, ages 121 years, enrolled in the study. Volunteers received two doses of vaccine six weeks apart by jet injector. Both the experimental vaccine and the control vaccine (Menomune, A, C, Y and W135 meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine) were well tolerated with minor side-effects. Active surveillance for suspected cases of meningococcal disease was conducted for 20 months in Iquique. Eighteen cases of group B meningococcal disease were confirmed during the 20 months. Efficacy was estimated to be 51% (p=0.11) for all ages combined. In children aged 14 no protection was evident, but in volunteers aged 521 vaccine efficacy was 70% (p=0.045). The IgG antibody response by ELISA was characterized by a large booster effect after the second dose, followed by a substantial drop in antibody levels by 6 months. The youngest children had the highest responses. The bactericidal antibody response, on the other hand, was characterized by the lack of a significant booster response, higher responses in the older children, and an increase in the geometric mean titer in the later months of the study in the older children.KeywordsNeisseria meningitidis; vaccine; efficacy trial; noncovalent complexCopyright  1995 Published by Elsevier Ltd.
