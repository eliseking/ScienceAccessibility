Expression of the synthetic LT-B gene in potato plants under the control of a constitutive promoter yielded increased accumulation of LT-B in leaves and tubers, as compared to the bacterial LT-B gene. The plant-derived LT-B assembled into native pentameric structures as evidenced by its ability to bind ganglioside. The authors demonstrated immunogenicity by feeding mice the raw tubers and comparing the anti-LT-B serum IgG and faecal IgA to that produced in mice gavaged with bacterial LT-B. Mice were fed three weekly doses of 5 g tuber tissue containing either 20 or 50 g LT-B, or gavaged weekly with 5 g of LT-B from recombinant E. coli. One week after the third dose, mice immunized with potato LT-B had higher levels of serum and mucosal anti-LT-B than those gavaged with bacterial LT-B. Mice were challenged by oral administration of 25 g LT, and protection assessed by comparing the gut/carcass mass ratios. Although none of the mice were completely protected, the higher dose potato vaccine compared favourably with the bacterial vaccine. These findings show that an edible vaccine against E. coli LT-B is feasible.Keywordspotato; plant-vaccine; diarrhoeal-disease; enterotoxin-LT-B; E. coli; mouseRecommended articlesCiting articles (0)Current address: Alpha Diagnostic International Inc., 8491 Abe Lincoln, San Antonio, TX 78240, USA.Copyright  1998 Published by Elsevier Ltd.Recommended articlesCiting articles\nElsevierAbout ScienceDirectRemote accessShopping cartContact and supportTerms and conditionsPrivacy policyCookies are used by this site.
