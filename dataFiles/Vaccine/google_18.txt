About 14 million people, including teens, become infected with HPV each year.\nMost people with HPV never develop symptoms or health problems.

HPV vaccination can prevent most of the cancers (about 28,000) from occurring.\nWhen should my child be vaccinated?\nAll kids who are 11 or 12 years old should get two shots of HPV vaccine six to twelve months apart. Adolescents who receive their two shots less than five months apart will require a third dose of HPV vaccine.\nHPV Infographic\n3 Things Parents Need to Know about Preventing Cancers\nIf your teen hasn't gotten the vaccine yet, talk to their doctor or nurse about getting it for them as soon as possible.
