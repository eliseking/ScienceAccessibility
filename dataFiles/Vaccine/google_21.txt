A single dose provides lifelong protection for most people.\nYellow Fever Vaccine Recommendations\nYellow fever vaccine is recommended for people aged 9 months who are traveling to or living in areas at risk for yellow fever virus transmission in South America and Africa. Yellow fever vaccine may be required for entry into certain countries. Yellow fever vaccination requirements and recommendations for specific countries are available on the CDC Travelers' Health page.\nYellow fever vaccine is available only at designated vaccination centers. Locations of centers are available from your local health department or on CDCs Travelers Health Yellow Fever Vaccination Clinics page.\nFor most travelers, a single dose of yellow fever vaccine provides long-lasting protection and a booster dose of the vaccine is not needed. However, some travelers may require a booster dose. Also, certain countries might require a booster dose of the vaccine; visit Travelers Health for information on specific country requirements. Talk to your healthcare provider to determine if you may need a dose of yellow fever vaccine or a booster dose before your trip to an area at risk for yellow fever.\nReactions to Yellow Fever Vaccine\nReactions to yellow fever vaccine are generally mild and include headaches, muscle aches, and low-grade fevers. There have been reports of rare but serious events following yellow fever vaccination. These events include life-threatening allergic reaction, disease affecting the nervous system, and disease affecting certain internal organs. Testing can be performed to look for certain serious adverse events. Talk to your healthcare provider or travel health clinic provider if you have symptoms that concern you following your yellow fever vaccination.\nBecause certain people have an increased risk of developing a serious adverse event if vaccinated with yellow fever vaccine, vaccine is not recommended (i.e., contraindicated) for people with:\nAllergy to a vaccine component\nAge <6 months\nSymptomatic HIV infection or CD4+ T-lymphocytes <200/mm3 (<15% of total in children aged <6 years)\nThymus disorder associated with abnormal immune function\nPrimary immunodeficiencies\nMalignant neoplasms\nTransplantation\nImmunosuppressive and immunomodulatory therapies\nSome people may have an increased risk of an adverse event, but they may benefit from receiving the vaccine.
