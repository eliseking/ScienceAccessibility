Vaccines approved for marketing may also be required to undergo additional studies to further evaluate the vaccine and often to address specific questions about the vaccine's safety, effectiveness or possible side effects.\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, vaccines have reduced preventable infectious diseases to an all-time low and now few people experience the devastating effects of measles, pertussis and other illnesses.\nThe Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) regulates vaccine products. Many of these are childhood vaccines that have contributed to a significant reduction of vaccine-preventable diseases.\nVaccines Information\nBiologics License Applications (BLA) Process (CBER)\nCDC National Immunization Program\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention\nQuestions about Vaccines\nVaccines\nFDA Consumer Updates\nVaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee\nVaccine and Related Biological Product Guidances\nVaccines Licensed for Use in the United States\nVaccine Notices, Proposed and Final Rules\nVaccine Safety & Availability\nCommon Ingredients in U.S. Licensed Vaccines\nVaccine Adverse Events\nReport adverse events (side effects) related to the administration of U.S. licensed vaccines\nVaccine Safety & Availability\nInfluenza Virus Vaccine Safety & Availability\nVaccine Safety Questions and Answers\nRecommendations for the Use of Vaccines Manufactured with Bovine-Derived Materials\nThimerosal in Vaccines\nFDA and CDC Issue Alert on Menactra Meningococcal Vaccine and Guillain Barre Syndrome [ARCHIVED]\nFDA Press Release, September 30, 2005\nMMWR - Guillain-Barr Syndrome Among Recipients of Menactra Meningococcal Conjugate Vaccine\nMMWR Weekly Report, Centers for Disease Control, October 20, 2006\nCounterterrorism\nAnthrax\nSmallpox\nPandemic\nPandemic Influenza Information\nSeasonal Information\nGet Set for a Healthy Winter Season\nThis is prime time for colds, influenza (flu), and other respiratory illnesses.\nInfluenza Virus Vaccine Safety & Availability\nRecalls & Alerts\nRecalls (Biologics)\nCBER-Regulated Products: Shortages and Discontinuations\nReport a Problem to the Center for Biologics Evaluation & Research\nApprovals & Clearances\nBiologics Products & Establishments\nRelated Information\nVaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee\nVaccine and Related Biological Product Guidances\nVaccine Notices, Proposed and Final Rules\nVaccines Research\nContact FDA\n(800) 835-4709\n(240) 402-8010\nocod@fda.hhs.gov\nConsumer Affairs Branch (CBER)\nDivision of Communication and Consumer Affairs\nOffice of Communication, Outreach and Development\nFood and Drug Administration\n10903 New Hampshire Avenue\nBuilding 71 Room 3103\nSilver Spring,\nMD\n20993-0002\nMore in Vaccines\nQuestions about Vaccines\nApproved Products\nResources for You\nConsumers (Biologics)\nHealthcare Providers (Biologics)\nIndustry (Biologics)\nAbout the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER)\nPage Last Updated: 12/30/2016\nNote: If you need help accessing information in different file formats, see Instructions for Downloading Viewers and Players.\nLanguage Assistance Available: Espaol |  | Ting Vit |  | Tagalog |  |  | Kreyl Ayisyen | Franais | Polski | Portugus | Italiano | Deutsch |  |  | English\nFDA\nAccessibility\nCareers\nFDA Basics\nFOIA\nNo FEAR Act\nSite Map\nNondiscrimination\nWebsite Policies\nU.S. Food and Drug Administration\n10903 New Hampshire Avenue\nSilver Spring, MD 20993\n1-888-INFO-FDA (1-888-463-6332)\nContact FDA\nSubscribe to FDA RSS feeds\nFollow FDA on Twitter\nFollow FDA on Facebook\nView FDA videos on YouTube\nView FDA photos on Flickr\nFDA Archive\nCombination Products\nAdvisory Committees\nRegulatory Information\nSafety\nEmergency Preparedness\nInternational Programs\nNews & Events\nTraining & Continuing Education\nInspections & Compliance\nFederal, State & Local Officials\nConsumers\nHealth Professionals\nScience & Research\nIndustry\nScroll back to top\nPopular Content\nHome\nLatest Recalls\nReport an Adverse Event\nMedWatch Safety Alerts\nNews Releases\nConsumer Updates\nAbout FDA\nContact FDA\nBrowse by Product Area\nProduct Areas\nback\nFood\nDrugs\nMedical Devices\nRadiation-Emitting Products\nVaccines, Blood & Biologics\nAnimal & Veterinary\nCosmetics\nTobacco Products"
