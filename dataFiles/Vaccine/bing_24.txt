(Medicine) a suspension of dead, attenuated, or otherwise modified microorganisms (viruses, bacteria, or rickettsiae) for inoculation to produce immunity to a disease by stimulating the production of antibodies2.

(vksin; esp. Brit. vk sin)

[180005; < New Latin (variolae)vaccnae cowpox =vacc(a) cow + -nae, feminine pl. of -nus -ine1] vaccine (vk-sn) A substance that stimulates cells in the immune system to recognize and attack disease-causing agents, especially through the production of antibodies. Most vaccines are given by injection or are swallowed as liquids. Vaccines may contain a weaker form of the disease-causing virus or bacterium or even a DNA fragment or some other component of the agent. See Note at
Jenner.Did You Know?
In the 1950s, polio epidemics left thousands of children with permanent physical disabilities. Today, kids are given a polio vaccine to keep them from catching the virus. That vaccine, like most others, works by stimulating the body's immune system to produce antibodiessubstances that defend the body against infection by recognizing and destroying disease-causing agents like viruses and bacteria. Scientists usually prepare vaccines by taking a sample of the disease-causing agent and weakening it with heat or chemicals. That way, the agent loses its ability to cause serious illness but is still able to stimulate the body to produce antibodies and provide immunity. But finding safe vaccines that are also effective is a challenge. Today, scientists are able to change the structure of viruses and bacteria at the level of their DNA. They remove the most harmful fragments of DNA and then use what is left in vaccines. New vaccines containing harmless bits of DNA from disease-causing germs have also been developedall to make diseases like polio a thing of the past.

(Your Health)The 5,417 volunteers--consisting of more than 5,100 gay men and about 300 women in the United States, Canada, and the Netherlands--were divided into a vaccine group and a placebo group; like other participants, Moreau was never told which group he was in.Trials and tribulations: disappointing results from the first-ever human AIDS vaccine trial leave researchers asking what's next.
