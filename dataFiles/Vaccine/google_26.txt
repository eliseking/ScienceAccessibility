Mumps typically starts with fever, headache, muscle aches, tiredness, and loss of appetite. Then, most people will have swelling of their salivary glands. This is what causes the puffy cheeks and a tender, swollen jaw.\nMumps can be prevented with MMR vaccine. This protects against three diseases: measles, mumps, and rubella. CDC recommends children get two doses of MMR vaccine, starting with the first dose at 12 through 15 months of age, and the second dose at 4 through 6 years of age. Teens and adults also should also be up to date on their MMR vaccination.\nMMR vaccine is very safe and effective. The mumps component of the MMR vaccine is about 88% (range: 66-95%) effective when a person gets two doses; one dose is about 78% (range: 49%92%) effective.\nChildren may also get MMRV vaccine, which protects against measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella (chickenpox). This vaccine is only licensed for use in children who are 12 months through 12 years of age.\nBefore the U.S. mumps vaccination program started in 1967, mumps was a universal disease of childhood. Since the pre-vaccine era, there has been a more than 99% decrease in mumps cases in the United States. Mumps outbreaks can still occur in highly vaccinated U.S. communities, particularly in close-contact settings such as schools, colleges, and camps. However, high vaccination coverage helps to limit the size, duration, and spread of mumps outbreaks.\nCDC recommends that children get two doses of MMR vaccine:\nthe first dose at 12 through 15 months of age, and\nthe second dose at 4 through 6 years of age.\nTeens and adults should also be up to date on MMR vaccinations.\nWhat Everyone Should Know\nBasic information for people interested in the vaccine\nInformation for Healthcare Professionals\nVaccine recommendations and contraindications; composition, dosage, and administration; handling and storage\nAbbreviations\nMMR=measles, mumps, and rubella combination vaccine\nMMRV=measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella combination vaccine\nFile Formats Help:How do I view different file formats (PDF, DOC, PPT, MPEG) on this site?\nAdobe PDF file\nMicrosoft PowerPoint file\nMicrosoft Word file\nMicrosoft Excel file\nAudio/Video file\nApple Quicktime file\nRealPlayer file\nText file\nZip Archive file\nSAS file\nePub file\nRIS file\nPage last reviewed: November 22, 2016\nPage last updated: November 22, 2016\nContent source:\nNational Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases\nEmail\nRecommend\nTweet\nYouTube\nInstagram\nListen\nWatch\nRSS\nABOUT\nAbout CDC\nJobs\nFunding\nLEGAL\nPolicies\nPrivacy\nFOIA\nNo Fear Act\nOIG\n1600 Clifton Road\nAtlanta,\nGA\n30329-4027\nUSA\n800-CDC-INFO (800-232-4636),\nTTY: 888-232-6348\nEmail CDC-INFO\nU.S. Department of Health & Human Services\nHHS/Open\nUSA.gov\nTop'
