Infants who received LGG showed an increased response with regard to rotavirus-specific IgM secreting cells, measured using an ELISPOT technique, on day 8 after vaccination. In infants receiving LGG or placebo, respectively, a rotavirus IgM seroconversion was detected in\n(96%) versus\n(85%) cases (p=0.15) and rotavirus IgA seroconversion was detected in\n(93%) versus\n(74%) cases (p=0.05). These findings suggest that LGG has an immunostimulating effect on oral rotavirus vaccination. The clinical significance of LGG-enhanced immune responses to oral vaccines should be further evaluated.KeywordsRotavirus vaccine; Lactobacillus; immunogenicity; adjuvantsTo whom correspondence should be addressed.Copyright  1995 Published by Elsevier Ltd.\nElsevierAbout ScienceDirectRemote accessShopping cartContact and supportTerms and conditionsPrivacy policyCookies are used by this site.
