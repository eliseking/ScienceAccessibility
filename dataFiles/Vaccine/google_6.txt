A vaccine typically contains an agent that resembles a disease-causing microorganism, and is often made from weakened or killed forms of the microbe, its toxins or one of its surface proteins. The agent stimulates the body\'s immune system to recognize the agent as foreign, destroy it, and "remember" it, so that the immune system can more easily recognize and destroy any of these microorganisms that it later encounters.\nHighlight\nWorld Immunization Week 2016: Close the immunization gap\nCampaign materials\nCampaign toolkit\nGeneral information\nWhat are some of the myths  and facts  about vaccination?\nFact sheets on immunization\nMultimedia\nLao Peoples Democratic Republic: The beginning of the end of Japanese encephalitisApril 2015\nFeatures on immunization and vaccines\nWHO programmes and activities\nDepartment of Immunization, Vaccines and Biologicals\nVaccines in WHO regions\nAfrican Region\nRegion of the Americas\nSouth-East Asia Region\nEuropean Region\nEastern Mediterranean Region\nWestern Pacific Region\nPartners\nGAVI Alliance\nTechnical information\nPrequalification of vaccines\nResearch and development\nGlobal Vaccine Safety\nNew and Under-utilized Vaccines Implementation (NUVI)\nVaccines standardization\nVaccines for pandemic (H1N1) 2009\nPublications\nGlobal Vaccine Action Plan 2011-2020\nVaccine research and development\nMore publications\nRelated topics\nChild health\nImmunization\nInfant, Newborn\nPharmaceutical products\nTravel and health\nYou are here:\nHealth topics\nVaccines\nQuick Links\nSitemap\nHome\nHealth topics\nData\nMedia centre\nPublications\nCountries\nProgrammes and projects\nGovernance\nAbout\nWHO\nHelp and Services\nContacts\nFAQs\nEmployment\nFeedback\nPrivacy\nE-mail scams\nWHO Regional Offices\nWHO African Region\nWHO Region of the Americas\nWHO South-East Asia Region\nWHO European Region\nWHO Eastern Mediterranean Region\nWHO Western Pacific Region\n\nWHO 2017\nBack to top\nEmail Address\nSign up for WHO updates'
