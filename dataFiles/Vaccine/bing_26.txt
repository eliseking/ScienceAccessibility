Vaccine Information Statements
Vaccine Information Statements
By Federal Law, You Must Provide Current VISs
About Vaccine Information Statements
Vaccine Information Statements (VISs) are information sheets produced by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). VISs explain both the benefits and risks of a vaccine to adult vaccine recipients and the parents or legal representatives of
vaccinees who are children and adolescents. Federal law requires that VISs be handed out whenever certain vaccinations are given (before each dose).
NOTE: All VISs on this site are in PDF format. You will need Adobe Reader to view them. The PDF versions of these documents are the same as the versions you would receive by ordering directly from CDC or your local health department. These documents are suitable for reproducing as handouts for patients.
How to Use VISs
It's Federal Law! You must give your patients current VISs Explains why it is necessary to always use the most current version of a VIS and lists the current VIS dates
What's New with VISs CDC offers the latest information about upcoming and current VIS updates
