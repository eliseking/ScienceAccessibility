Influenza vaccination in 2000: recommendations and vaccine use in 50 developed and rapidly developing countriesG.A. van Essena, , , A.M. Palacheb, E. Forleoc, D.S. Fedsonda Julius Center for Health Sciences and Primary Care, University Medical Center Utrecht, P.O. Box 85060, 3508 AB Utrecht, The Netherlandsb Solvay Pharmaceuticals BV, Weesp, The Netherlandsc Vigivirus, Sao Paulo, Brazild Sergy Haut, FranceAvailable online 5 February 2003AbstractInfluenza vaccination is becoming an increasingly important aspect of public health programs in developed and rapidly developing countries. In 2000, most of these countries had national recommendations to vaccinate elderly people and those with high-risk conditions. Levels of vaccine use, however, varied widely and several rapidly developing countries had higher levels than those seen in many developed countries. More than one-third of all influenza vaccinations occurred in countries outside North America, western Europe and Australia and New Zealand. With increasing vaccine use, all countries will be better prepared for the next pandemic. Nonetheless, those countries that use but do not produce influenza vaccine will find it difficult to obtain supplies of pandemic vaccine.KeywordsInfluenza vaccination; Developed countries; Rapidly developing countriesCorresponding author.
