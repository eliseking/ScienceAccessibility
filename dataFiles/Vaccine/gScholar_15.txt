Three groups of four volunteers received three administrations of DNA encoding the surface antigen of HBV at one of the three dose levels (1, 2, or 4 g). The vaccine was safe and well tolerated, causing only transient and mild to moderate responses at the site of administration. HBV-specific antibody and both CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses were measured before and after each immunization. All the volunteers developed protective antibody responses of at least 10 mIU/ml. In volunteers who were positive for the HLA class I A2 allele, the vaccine also induced antigen-specific CD8+ T cells that bound HLA-A2/HBsAg335343 tetramers, secreted IFN-, and lysed target cells presenting a hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) CTL epitope. Enumeration of HBsAg-specific T cells producing cytokine indicated preferential induction of a Type 1 T helper cell response. These results provide the first demonstration of a DNA vaccine inducing protective antibody titers and both humoral and cell-mediated immune responses in humans.KeywordsDNA vaccine; HBV; Clinical trialCorresponding author.
