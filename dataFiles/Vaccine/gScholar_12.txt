These data suggest that the pneumococcus has a major role in the development of pneumonia associated with these viruses and that viruses contribute to the pathogenesis of bacterial pneumonia.\nNOTE:\nIn the version of this article originally published online, the species name was misspelled Streptococcus pnemoniae in the title of the article. The name should be Streptococcus pneumoniae.
