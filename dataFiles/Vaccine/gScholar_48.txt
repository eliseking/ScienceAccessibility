PaperA sub-unit vaccine elicits IgG in serum, spleen cell cultures and bronchial washings and protects immunized animals against pneumonic plagueE. Diane Williamson, , Steven M. Eley, Anthony J. Stagg, Michael Green, Paul Russell, Richard W. Titball DERA (Chemical and Biological Defence Sector), Porton Down, Salisbury, Wiltshire SP4 OJQ, UKReceived 31 July 1996, Revised 8 October 1996, Accepted 27 November 1996, Available online 5 January 1998AbstractIn this study, the protection afforded against aerosolized Yersinia pestis by injection of an alhydrogel-adsorbed sub-unit vaccine has been compared with that given by an existing killed whole cell vaccine licensed for human use. The sub-unit vaccine protected mice against exposure to > 104 colony-forming units (c.f.u.) of virulent plague organisms (100 LD50 doses), whereas the whole cell vaccine provided only 50% protection against 1.8  103 c.f.u. In sub-unit vaccinees, IgG to each of the F1 and V antigens contained in the vaccine, was detected in serum, on direct secretion by spleen cells and in broncho-alveolar washings (BAL). In killed whole cell vaccinees, physiologically significant levels of IgG to F1 only were detectable in equivalent samples. Levels of F1-specific IgG in serum, secreted from spleen cells and in BAL were significantly higher (P < 0.01) in sub-unit compared with killed whole cell vaccinees. IgA was not detected in BAL from intra-muscularly dosed sub-unit vaccinees and thus the protection achieved against inhalational challenge with Yersinia pestis is attributed to the induction of systemic immunity to both the F1 and V antigens in the sub-unit vaccine. The enhanced protective efficacy of this sub-unit vaccine over an existing vaccine has been demonstrated in an animal model of pneumonic plague.Keywordssub-unit vaccine; pneumonic plague; immunological correlates; protectionAuthor to whom all correspondence should be addressed.Copyright  1997 Published by Elsevier Ltd.
