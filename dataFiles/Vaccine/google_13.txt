Many of the viruses and bacteria that cause illness still circulate in this country or are only a plane ride away. Thats why its important that children, especially infants and young children, receive recommended immunizations on time. Vaccines also protect teenagers and adults to keep them healthy throughout their lives.\nThis section provides information about the diseases you can prevent with vaccines. Each disease has its own page, with three tabs:\nVaccine Basics includes information about the vaccine, who should receive it, and how many doses are recommended.\nLearn About includes signs and symptoms of the disease, who is usually affected by it, and how it is spread between people.\nTake Action directs you to resources for getting vaccinated, provides the Vaccine Information Statement (VIS), and connects you to in-depth information available on other federal Web sites.\nVaccine Terms A-Z\nVisit the full glossaryVaccine acronyms and abbreviations\nWhen Should You Be Vaccinated?\nChoose your age group...\nInfants, Children and Teens\nChild Catch-Up 4 months-18\nCollege & Young Adults 18-24\nAdults 19+\nSeniors 65+\nPregnant\nHealth Conditions\nThe Journey of Your Child's Vaccine\nLearn in words and pictures about the journey of your child's vaccine.\nDid You Know?\nBefore the development and widespread use of safe and effective vaccines, infectious diseases threatened the lives of millions of children and adults worldwide.\nA federal government Website managed by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services\n200 Independence Avenue, S.W.\nWashington, D.C. 20201\nSite Map\nHome\nBasics\nDiseases\nWho and When\nTravel\nGetting Vaccinated\nMore Info\nGlossary\nOur Partners\nRelated Websites\nAIDS.gov\nBiomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA)\nCDC Vaccines\nCountermeasures Injury Compensation Program\nCDC Flu\nHealthcare.gov\nHealthfinder.gov\nMilitary Health - Vaccines\nNational Vaccine Program Office (NVPO)\nNational Vaccine Injury Compensation Program\nVeterans' Affairs\nAdditional Information\nAbout Vaccines.gov\nPrivacy Policy\nAccessibility\nDisclaimers\nContact Us\nViewers & Players\nGive Feedback\nNondiscrimination Notice"
