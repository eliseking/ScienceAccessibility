Every flu season is different, and influenza infection can affect people differently, but millions of people get the flu every year, hundreds of thousands of people are hospitalized and thousands or tens of thousands of people die from flu-related causes every year. Even healthy people can get very sick from the flu and spread it to others. CDC estimates that flu-related hospitalizations since 2010 ranged from 140,000 to 710,000, while flu-related deaths are estimated to have ranged from 12,000 to 56,000.During flu season, flu viruses circulate at higher levels in the U.S. population. ("Flu season" in the United States can begin as early as October and last as late as May.) An annual seasonal flu vaccine is the best way to reduce your risk of getting sick with seasonal flu and spreading it to others. When more people get vaccinated against the flu, less flu can spread through that community.\nHow do flu vaccines work?\nFlu vaccines cause antibodies to develop in the body about two weeks after vaccination. These antibodies provide protection against infection with the viruses that are in the vaccine.\nThe seasonal flu vaccine protects against the influenza viruses that research indicates will be most common during the upcoming season. Traditional flu vaccines (called "trivalent" vaccines) are made to protect against three flu viruses; an influenza A (H1N1) virus, an influenza A (H3N2) virus, and an influenza B virus. There are also flu vaccines made to protect against four flu viruses (called "quadrivalent" vaccines). These vaccines protect against the same viruses as the trivalent vaccine and an additional B virus.\nWhat kinds of flu vaccines are available?\nCDC recommends use of injectable influenza vaccines (including inactivated influenza vaccines and recombinant influenza vaccines) during 2016-2017. The nasal spray flu vaccine (live attenuated influenza vaccine or LAIV) should not be used during 2016-2017.\nBoth trivalent (three-component) and quadrivalent (four-component) flu vaccines will be available.\nTrivalent flu vaccines include:\nStandard-dose trivalent shots (IIV3) that are manufactured using virus grown in eggs. Different flu shots are approved for different age groups. Most flu shots are given in the arm (muscle) with a needle. One trivalent vaccine formulation can be given with a jet injector, for persons aged 18 through 64 years.\nA high-dose trivalent shot, approved for people 65 and older.\nA recombinant trivalent shot that is egg-free, approved for people 18 years and older.\nA trivalent flu shot made with adjuvant (an ingredient of a vaccine that helps create a stronger immune response in the patients body), approved for people 65 years of age and older (new this season).\nQuadrivalent flu vaccines include:\nQuadrivalent flu shots approved for use in different age groups.\nAn intradermal quadrivalent flu shot, which is injected into the skin instead of the muscle and uses a much smaller needle than the regular flu shot. It is approved for people 18 through 64 years of age.\nA quadrivalent flu shot containing virus grown in cell culture, which is approved for people 4 years of age and older (new this season).\nAre any of the available flu vaccines recommended over others?\nFor the 2016-2017 flu season, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends annual influenza vaccination for everyone 6 months and older with either the inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV) or the recombinant influenza vaccine (RIV). The nasal spray flu vaccine (live attenuated influenza vaccine or LAIV) should not be used during 2016-2017.There is no preference for one vaccine over another among the recommended, approved injectable influenza vaccines. There are many vaccine options to choose from, but the most important thing is for all people 6 months and older to get a flu vaccine every year. If you have questions about which vaccine is best for you, talk to your doctor or other health care professional.\nWho should get vaccinated this season?\nEveryone 6 months of age and older should get a flu vaccine every season. This recommendation has been in place since February 24, 2010 when CDCs Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) voted for universal flu vaccination in the United States to expand protection against the flu to more people.\nVaccination to prevent influenza is particularly important for people who are at high risk of serious complications from influenza. See People at High Risk of Developing Flu-Related Complications for a full list of age and health factors that confer increased risk.\nMore information is available at Who Should Get Vaccinated Against Influenza.\nTop of Page\nWho Should Not Be Vaccinated?\nCDC recommends use of the flu shot (inactivated influenza vaccine or IIV) and the recombinant influenza vaccine (RIV). The nasal spray flu vaccine (live attenuated influenza vaccine or LAIV) should not be used during 2016-2017. Different flu vaccines are approved for use in different groups of people. Factors that can determine a person\'s suitability for vaccination, or vaccination with a particular vaccine, include a person\'s age, health (current and past) and any allergies to flu vaccine or its components.\nPeople who cannot get a flu shot\nPeople who should talk to their doctor before getting the flu shot\nWhen should I get vaccinated?\nFlu vaccination should begin soon after vaccine becomes available, if possible by October. However, as long as flu viruses are circulating, vaccination should continue to be offered throughout the flu season, even in January or later. While seasonal influenza outbreaks can happen as early as October, during most seasons influenza activity peaks in January or later. Since it takes about two weeks after vaccination for antibodies to develop in the body that protect against influenza virus infection, it is best that people get vaccinated so they are protected before influenza begins spreading in their community.\nFlu vaccine is produced by private manufacturers, and the timing of availability depends on when production is completed. Shipments began in August and will continue throughout October and November until all vaccine is distributed.\nTop of Page\nWhere can I get a flu vaccine?\nFlu vaccines are offered in many locations, including doctor\'s offices, clinics, health departments, pharmacies and college health centers, as well as by many employers, and even in some schools.\nEven if you don\'t have a regular doctor or nurse, you can get a flu vaccine somewhere else, like a health department, pharmacy, urgent care clinic, and often your school, college health center, or workplace.\nThe following\nVaccine Locator is a useful tool for finding vaccine in your area.\nWhy do I need a flu vaccine every year?\nA flu vaccine is needed every season for two reasons. First, the body\'s immune response from vaccination declines over time, so an annual vaccine is needed for optimal protection. Second, because flu viruses are constantly changing, the formulation of the flu vaccine is reviewed each year and sometimes updated to keep up with changing flu viruses. For the best protection, everyone 6 months and older should get vaccinated annually.\nDoes flu vaccine work right away?\nNo. It takes about two weeks after vaccination for antibodies to develop in the body and provide protection against influenza virus infection. That\'s why it\'s better to get vaccinated early in the fall, before the flu season really gets under way.\nCan I get seasonal flu even though I got a flu vaccine this year?\nYes. There is still a possibility you could get the flu even if you got vaccinated. The ability of flu vaccine to protect a person depends on various factors, including the age and health status of the person being vaccinated, and also the similarity or "match" between the viruses used to make the vaccine and those circulating in the community. If the viruses in the vaccine and the influenza viruses circulating in the community are closely matched, vaccine effectiveness is higher. If they are not closely matched, vaccine effectiveness can be reduced. However, it\'s important to remember that even when the viruses are not closely matched, the vaccine can still protect many people and prevent flu-related complications. Such protection is possible because antibodies made in response to the vaccine can provide some protection (called cross-protection) against different but related influenza viruses.

For information specific to this season, visit About the Current Flu Season.\nVaccine Benefits\nWhat are the benefits of flu vaccination?\nWhile how well the flu vaccine works can vary, there are a lot of reasons to get a flu vaccine each year.\nFlu vaccination can keep you from getting sick with flu.\nFlu vaccination can reduce the risk of flu-associated hospitalization, including among children and older adults.\nA 2014 study* showed that flu vaccine reduced childrens risk of flu-related pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) admission by 74% during flu seasons from 2010-2012.\nAnother study published in the summer of 2016 showed that people 50 years and older who got a flu vaccine reduced their risk of getting hospitalized from flu by 57%.\nFlu vaccination is an important preventive tool for people with chronic health conditions.\nVaccination was associated with lower rates of some cardiac events among people with heart disease, especially among those who had had a cardiac event in the past year.\nFlu vaccination also has been shown to be associated with reduced hospitalizations among people with diabetes (79%) and chronic lung disease (52%).\nVaccination helps protect women during and after pregnancy. Getting vaccinated can also protect a baby after birth from flu. (Mom passes antibodies onto the developing baby during her pregnancy.)\nA study that looked at flu vaccine effectiveness in pregnant women found that vaccination reduced the risk of flu-associated acute respiratory infection by about one half.\nThere are studies that show that flu vaccine in a pregnant woman can reduce the risk of flu illness in her baby by up to half. This protective benefit was observed for up to four months after birth.\nFlu vaccination also may make your illness milder if you do get sick.\nGetting vaccinated yourself also protects people around you, including those who are more vulnerable to serious flu illness, like babies and young children, older people, and people with certain chronic health conditions.\n*References for the studies listed above can be found at Publications on Influenza Vaccine Benefits. Also see the What are the Benefits of Flu Vaccination? [237 KB, 2 pages] fact sheet.\nTop of Page\nVaccine Match\nWhat is meant by a "good match" between viruses in the vaccine and circulating influenza viruses?\nA good match is said to occur when the viruses in the vaccine and the viruses circulating among people during a given influenza season are closely related and the antibodies produced by vaccination protect against infection.\nWhat if circulating viruses and the vaccine viruses are different?\nDuring seasons when one or more of the circulating viruses are different from the vaccine viruses, vaccine effectiveness can be reduced.\nCan the vaccine provide protection even if the vaccine is not a "good" match?\nYes, antibodies made in response to vaccination with one flu virus can sometimes provide protection against different but related viruses. A less than optimal match may result in reduced vaccine effectiveness against the virus that is different from what is in the vaccine, but it can still provide some protection against influenza illness.\nIn addition, even when there is a less than optimal match or lower effectiveness against one virus, it\'s important to remember that the flu vaccine is designed to protect against three or four flu viruses, depending on the vaccine.\nFor these reasons, even during seasons when there is a less than optimal match, CDC continues to recommend flu vaccination. This is particularly important for people at high risk for serious flu complications, and their close contacts.\nWhy is there sometimes not a good match between a vaccine virus and circulating viruses?\nFlu viruses are constantly changing (called "antigenic drift")  they can change from one season to the next or they can even change within the course of one flu season. Experts must pick which viruses to include in the vaccine many months in advance in order for vaccine to be produced and delivered on time. (For more information about the vaccine virus selection process visit Selecting the Viruses in the Influenza (Flu) Vaccine.) Because of these factors, there is always the possibility of a less than optimal match between circulating viruses and the viruses in the vaccine.\nWill this season\'s vaccine be a good match for circulating viruses?\nIt\'s not possible to predict with certainty which flu viruses will predominate during a given season. Over the course of a flu season, CDC studies samples of flu viruses circulating during that season by looking at their genetic and antigenic properties to evaluate how close a match there is between the viruses recommended for vaccine production and circulating viruses. Data are published in the weekly FluView. In addition, CDC conducts studies each year to determine how well the vaccine protects against illness during that season. The results of these studies are typically published following the conclusion of the flu season and take into consideration all of the data collected during the season. Interim preliminary estimates of the vaccine\'s benefits that season using data available at that time also may be provided. For more information, see Vaccine Effectiveness  How Well Does the Flu Vaccine Work?\nTop of Page\nVaccine Side Effects (What to Expect)\nCan the flu vaccine give me the flu?\nNo, a flu vaccine cannot cause flu illness. Flu vaccines that are administered with a needle are currently made in two ways: the vaccine is made either with a) flu vaccine viruses that have been \'inactivated\' and are therefore not infectious, or b) with no flu vaccine viruses at all (which is the case for recombinant influenza vaccine). The nasal spray flu vaccine does contain live viruses. However, the viruses are attenuated (weakened), and therefore cannot cause flu illness. The weakened viruses are cold-adapted, which means they are designed to only cause infection at the cooler temperatures found within the nose. The viruses cannot infect the lungs or other areas where warmer temperatures exist.\nWhile a flu vaccine cannot give you flu illness, there are different side effects that may be associated with getting a flu shot or a nasal spray flu vaccine. These side effects are mild and short-lasting, especially when compared to symptoms of bad case of flu.\nThe flu shot: The viruses in the flu shot are killed (inactivated), so you cannot get the flu from a flu shot. Some minor side effects that may occur are:\nSoreness, redness, or swelling where the shot was given\nFever (low grade)\nAches\nThe nasal spray: The viruses in the nasal spray vaccine are weakened and do not cause severe symptoms often associated with influenza illness. In children, side effects from the nasal spray may include:\nRunny nose\nWheezing\nHeadache\nVomiting\nMuscle aches\nFever\nIn adults, side effects from the nasal spray vaccine may include:\nRunny nose\nHeadache\nSore throat\nCough\nIf these problems occur, they begin soon after vaccination and are mild and short-lived. Almost all people who receive influenza vaccine have no serious problems from it. However, on rare occasions, flu vaccination can cause serious problems, such as severe allergic reactions. People who think that they have been injured by the flu shot can file a claim for compensation from the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP).\nMore information about the safety of flu vaccines is available at Influenza Vaccine Safety.\nTop of Page\nVaccine Supply and Distribution\nHow much vaccine will be available during 2016-2017?\nFlu vaccine is produced by private manufacturers, so\nsupply depends on manufacturers. Vaccine manufacturers originally projected that as many as 157 million to 168 million doses of injectable flu vaccine (i.e., inactivated and recombinant flu vaccines) would be made available for the 2016-2017 season.\nWhere can I find information about vaccine supply?\nInformation about vaccine supply is available on the CDC influenza web site.\nWhy do manufacturers and distributors take a phased approach to vaccine distribution?\nInfluenza vaccine production begins as early as 6 to 9 months before the beginning of vaccine distribution. Even with this early start, it isn\'t possible to complete the entire production and distribution process prior to flu season, in part because of the limited number of influenza vaccine manufacturing plants in the United States and the large number of doses that are produced each year. Instead, influenza vaccine distribution takes place in a phased fashion over a number of months. Distribution usually begins in late summer and is complete near the end of November or early in December. This may result in some uncertainty making it difficult for vaccine providers to plan their vaccination activities. Manufacturers and distributors try to get some vaccine to as many providers as possible as early as possible so that they can begin vaccinating their patients.\nWhat role does the Department of Health and Human Services play in the supply and distribution of the seasonal influenza vaccine?\nInfluenza vaccine production and distribution are primarily private sector endeavors. The Department of Health and Human Services and CDC do not have the authority to control influenza vaccine distribution nor the resources to manage such an effort. However, the Department has made significant efforts to enhance production capacity of seasonal influenza vaccines, including supporting manufacturers as they invest in processes to stabilize and increase their production capacity.\nMore Information\nVaccine Information Statement: Inactivated Influenza Vaccine\nVaccine Information Statement: Live, Intranasal Influenza Vaccine\nTop of Page\nSpecial Consideration Regarding Egg Allergy\nThe recommendations for vaccination of people with egg allergies have changed for 2016-2017.\nPeople with egg allergies can receive any licensed, recommended age-appropriate influenza vaccine and no longer have to be monitored for 30 minutes after receiving the vaccine. People who have severe egg allergies should be vaccinated in a medical setting and be supervised by a health care provider who is able to recognize and manage severe allergic conditions.\nTop of Page\nInfluenza Types\nSeasonal\nAvian\nSwine/Variant\nPandemic\nOther\nGet Email Updates\nTo receive email updates about this page, enter your email address:\nEnter Email Address What\'s this?
