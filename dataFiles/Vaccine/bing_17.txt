Administered intramuscularly as a routine immunizing agent in infants and young children.Haemophilus b polysaccharide vaccine (HbPV) a preparation of highly purified capsular polysaccharide derived from Haemophilus influenzae type b, which stimulates an immune response in B lymphocytes only; administered intramuscularly or subcutaneously as an immunizing agent in children ages 18 months to 5 years.hepatitis A vaccine inactivated an inactivated whole virus vaccine derived from an attenuated strain of hepatitis A virus grown in cell culture; administered intramuscularly.hepatitis B vaccine a preparation of hepatitis B surface antigen, derived either from human plasma of carriers of hepatitis B (hepatitis B vaccine inactivated) or from cloning in yeast cells (hepatitis B vaccine [recombinant]); administered intramuscularly.heterologous vaccine a vaccine that confers protective immunity against a pathogen that shares cross-reacting antigens with the microorganisms in the vaccine.human diploid cell vaccine rabies vaccine prepared from rabies virus grown in cultures of human diploid embryo lung cells and inactivated; administered intramuscularly or intradermally.influenza virus vaccine a killed virus vaccine used in immunization against influenza; it is trivalent, usually containing two influenza A virus strains and one influenza B virus strain.live vaccine a vaccine prepared from live microorganisms that have been attenuated but retain their immunogenic properties.Lyme disease vaccine (recombinant OspA) a preparation of outer surface protein A (OspA), a cell surface lipoprotein of Borrelia burgdorferi, produced by recombinant technology; administered intramuscularly for active immunization against lyme disease.measles, mumps, and rubella virus vaccine live (MMR) a combination of live attenuated measles, mumps, and rubella viruses, administered subcutaneously for simultaneous immunization against measles, mumps, and rubella.measles and rubella virus vaccine live a combination of live attenuated measles and rubella viruses, administered subcutaneously for simultaneous immunization against measles and rubella.measles virus vaccine live a live attenuated virus vaccine used for immunization against measles, although it is usually administered as the combination measles, mumps, and rubella virus vaccine.meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine a preparation of a capsular antigen of Neisseria meningitidis, administered subcutaneously to provide immunity to meningitis.mumps virus vaccine live a live attenuated virus vaccine used in immunization against mumps; usually administered as the combination measles, mumps, and rubella virus vaccine.pertussis vaccine a preparation of killed Bordetella pertussis bacilli (whole-cell vaccine) or of purified antigenic components thereof (acellular vaccine), used to immunize against pertussis; generally used in combination with diphtheria and tetanus toxoids (DTP or DTaP).plague vaccine a preparation of killed Yersinia pestis bacilli, administered intramuscularly as an active immunizing agent against plague.pneumococcal heptavalent conjugate vaccine a preparation of capsular polysaccharides from the seven serotypes of Streptococcus pneumoniae most commonly isolated from children 6 years of age or younger, coupled to a nontoxic variant of diphtheria toxin; used as an active immunizing agent for infants and children at risk for pneumococcal disease, administered intramuscularly.pneumococcal vaccine polyvalent a preparation of purified capsular polysaccharides from the 23 serotypes of Streptococcus pneumoniae causing the majority of pneumococcal disease; used as an active immunizing agent in persons over 2 years of age, administered intramuscularly.poliovirus vaccine inactivated (IPV) a preparation of killed polioviruses of three types, given in a series of intramuscular or subcutaneous injections to immunize against poliomyelitis. It does not induce intestinal immunity and so is not effective for poliovirus eradication in areas where wild-type polioviruses still exist in large numbers. However, it does not cause vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis and so is preferred for routine immunization in areas where the risk of infection by a wild-type poliovirus is very low, as in the United States. Called also Salk vaccine.poliovirus vaccine live oral (OPV) an oral vaccine against poliomyelitis consisting of three types of live, attenuated polioviruses. It is given orally, often on a sugar cube, and so is convenient for administration to children and large groups of people. It induces both humoral and intestinal immunity, so is useful for immunization and poliomyelitis eradication in areas where wild-type polioviruses have not been eradicated. However, it can cause vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis in persons newly vaccinated with it and their contacts, which is considered an unjustifiable risk in countries such as the United States, where the risk of exposure to wild-type polioviruses is very low. Thus, for routine immunization in the United States, it has been superseded by poliovirus vaccine inactivated. Called also Sabin vaccine.polyvalent vaccine a vaccine prepared from cultures or antigens of more than one strain or species.purified chick embryo cell vaccine an inactivated virus vaccine used for pre- and postexposure rabies immunization, prepared from rabies virus grown in cultures of chicken fibroblasts; administered intramuscularly.rabies vaccine any of various vaccines against rabies consisting of inactivated virus, used for preexposure immunization to persons at high risk of exposure, such as veterinarians, and for postexposure prophylaxis in conjunction with rabies immune globulin.

[vaksn, vaksn, -sin] Etymology: L, vaccinus
a suspension of attenuated or killed microorganisms administered intradermally, intramuscularly, orally, or subcutaneously to induce active immunity to infectious disease. Viruses and rickettsia used in some vaccines are grown in avian embryos, rabbit brain tissue, or monkey kidney tissue, and the organisms are usually inactivated by formalin, phenol, or beta-propiolactone. Bacteria for some vaccines may be inactivated by acetone, formalin, heat, or phenol. Vaccines may be used as single agents or in combinations. Compare antiserum.
vaccine Immunology A mixture of live, live-attenuated, killed, complete or incomplete microorganisms or their products, that contains antigens capable of stimulating production of specific protective antibodies against a pathogen; vaccines may be biochemically synthesized or made by recombinant DNA techniques Effective vaccines Diphtheria, HAV, HBV, influenza, measles, pertussis, S pneumoniae, tetanusvaccine
(vak-sn') Any preparation intended for active immunologic prophylaxis, e.g., preparations of killed microbes of virulent strains or living microbes of attenuated (variant or mutant) strains, or microbial, fungal, plant, protozoal, or metazoan derivatives or product. [L. vaccinus, relating to a cow, vacca]vaccine A suspension of microorganisms of one particular type that have been killed or modified so as to be safe, given to promote the production of specific ANTIBODIES to the organism for purposes of future protection against infection.vaccine a preparation containing live, attenuated (see ATTENUATION).or inactivated (killed) microorganisms (or some part or product of them), that is used to stimulate an IMMUNE RESPONSE in the recipient, which gains IMMUNITY. The Salk polio vaccine is an example of a vaccine that contains inactivated viruses, whereas the Sabin polio vaccine is a LIVE VACCINE. The name comes from the Latin vaccinus,
of cows, and relates to the work of Edward JENNER on cowpox. Vaccines are not quick-acting, but rely on the recipient to build up a supply of ANTIBODIES gradually. Compare SERUM (3). See also COMBINATION VACCINE, DNA VACCINE, SUBUNIT VACCINE.VaccineA preparation using a non-infectious element or relative of a particular virus or bacteria, and administered with the intention of halting the progress of an infection, or completely preventing it.Mentioned in: Encephalitis, Hepatitis A, Hepatitis B, Hepatitis E, Smallpoxvaccine preparation designed to act as disease prophylaxis BCG Vaccine; bacille Calmette-Gurin vaccine

Do Vaccines cause Autism? I have heard all over the news lately that the vaccines we give our children can cause Autism. Is this true? Is it dangerous? Should I vaccinate my one year old son?A. NOAndrew Wakefield MD started the controversy when publish the idea in Lancet. He was paid 130,000 dollars to lieCheck this link for full story:http://www.thedoctorsvideos.com/video/749/MMR-and-Autism-The-Andrew-Wakefield-StoryQ. Who Should Receive the Flu Vaccine? Should I go get vaccinated for the flu? I have been told it is advised only for certain people, so who should receive this vaccine?A. before you would like to go on with any vaccination, you should check out this very long list of links and create your own opinion:http://www.aegis.ch/neu/links.htmlat the bottom you will also find links in english. vaccinations in general are very disputable/dubious and it is probably time that we learn about it.Q. Does the flu vaccine protect from all kinds of flu? If I get a flu vaccine does that mean I am completely protected from getting the flu?A. No, the vaccine does not give complete protection from all the flu types out there. The vaccine protects from the most common types of flu, which are: H3N2, H1N1 and one B virus.
