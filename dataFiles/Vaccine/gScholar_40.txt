PaperDevelopment of a mammalian cell (Vero) derived candidate influenza virus vaccineO Kistner, P.N. Barrett, , W. Mundt, M. Reiter, S. Schober-Bendixen, F. Dorner Biomedical Research Center, Baxter-Immuno, Uferstr. 15, A-2304 Orth/Donau, AustriaReceived 15 July 1997, Revised 24 October 1997, Accepted 28 October 1997, Available online 5 August 1998AbstractInfluenza vaccine production is dependent on the availability of embryonated hen eggs for virus growth. This is an extremely cumbersome system with many disadvantages with respect to selection of virus variants and presence of adventitious viruses. We have developed an alternative cell culture system which allows rapid production of large volumes of vaccine. The World Health Organisation (WHO) approved Vero cell line was used in serum-free culture to grow a multitude of influenza strains to high titre. This system could be scaled-up to allow vaccine production with a 1200 litre fermenter volume. A purification scheme was developed which resulted in a high purity whole virus vaccine. This was demonstrated to be at least as immunogenic as a conventional egg-derived preparation in a mouse model.KeywordsVero cell; influenza vaccine; serum freeAuthor to whom all correspondence should be addressed.Copyright  1998 Published by Elsevier Ltd.
