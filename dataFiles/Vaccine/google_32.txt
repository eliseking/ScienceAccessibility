The VSD started in 1990 and continues today in order to monitor safety of vaccines and conduct studies about rare and serious adverse events following immunization.\nThe VSD uses electronic health data from each participating site. This includes information on vaccines - the kind of vaccine that is given to each patient, date of vaccination, and other vaccinations given on the same day. The VSD also uses information on medical illnesses that have been diagnosed at doctors offices, urgent care visits, emergency department visits and hospital stays. The VSD conducts vaccine safety studies based on questions or concerns raised from the medical literature and reports to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). When there are new vaccines that have been recommended for use in the United States or if there are changes in how a vaccine is recommended, the VSD will monitor the safety of these vaccines.\nThe VSD has a long history of monitoring and evaluating the safety of vaccines. Since 1990, investigators from the VSD have published many studies to address vaccine safety concerns. Examples of VSDs work include the following:\nWhite Paper on Studying the Safety of the Childhood Immunization Schedule\n[PDF\n- 918 KB]\nAre vaccines that contain additives safe for children? How about vaccines with preservatives?\nAre rotavirus vaccines safe for infants?\nDo vaccines cause febrile seizures?\nAre there safety concerns following HPV vaccine?\nTop of Page\nParticipating VSD Healthcare Organizations\nGroup Health Cooperative of Puget Sound, Seattle, Washington\nHarvard Pilgrim Health Care, Boston, Massachusetts\nHealthPartners Research Foundation, Minneapolis, Minnesota\nKaiser Permanente Northwest, Portland, Oregon\nKaiser Permanente Medical Care Program of Northern California, Oakland, California\nKaiser Permanente Colorado, Denver, Colorado\nKaiser Permanente of Georgia, Atlanta, GA\nMarshfield Clinic Research Foundation, Marshfield, Wisconsin\nSouthern California Kaiser Permanente Health Care Program, Los Angeles, California\nTop of Page\nObjectives of the VSD\nTo conduct research on important vaccine safety questions in large populations\nTo conduct vaccine safety studies that come from questions or concerns in the medical literature or from other vaccine safety systems, like VAERS\nTo monitor possible adverse events when new vaccines are licensed or when there are new vaccine recommendations\nTo provide information to committees who make recommendations for the nation\nTop of Page\nRapid Cycle Analysis\nRapid Cycle Analysis (RCA)\nallows VSD to detect adverse events following vaccination in near real time so the public can be informed quickly of possible risks.\nUsing VSD data that are updated each week, the rates of adverse events that occur in people who have received a particular vaccine are compared to the rate of adverse events that occurs in a similar group of people who have not received that vaccine. If the rate of adverse events among vaccinated people is higher than among the comparison group, the vaccine may be associated with an adverse event. VSD has used RCA to publish important safety information regarding many vaccines, including:\nPentacel (DTaP-IPV/Hib)\n(diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis [DTap], HiB, and polio)\nKinrix (DTaP-IPV)\n(DTaP and polio)\nGardasil (human papillomavirus)\nInfluenza\nSeasonal\n2009 H1N1\nRotavirus\nMeningococcal\nMeasles, mumps, rubella, and varicella (MMRV)\nTetanus, Diphtheria, Pertussis (Tdap)\nTop of Page\nEvaluating Safety of Vaccines in Pregnancy\nVaccination protects pregnant women and unborn babies from several preventable diseases. Because it is so important to protect pregnant women, evaluating the safety of vaccines given to women during pregnancy [PDF - 181 KB] is a high priority for the VSD.\nUsing electronic health record to determine a womans stage in her pregnancy is complicated. The VSD has developed algorithms to identify pregnant women and determine the start and end dates of the pregnancy. VSD is also able to use data to study the health of children born to women who were vaccinated during pregnancy. VSD has published 14 studies related to pregnancy and vaccination during pregnancy and is currently studying the safety of Tdap vaccination, inadvertent HPV vaccination, and influenza vaccination during pregnancy.\nTop of Page\nResearch Methods to Study Vaccine Safety\nVSD investigators have pioneered the development of statistical methods to conduct valid, accurate vaccine safety studies. Methods developed by the VSD in the past have been adopted by other researchers using large-linked databases and VSD investigators continue to develop and refine statistical approaches for vaccine safety research. Methods developed by the VSD include:\nmaximized sequential probability ratio test (MaxSPRT [PDF- 259 KB]) (CMaxSPRT)\ngroup sequential analysis\ncase-centered analysis\nThese methods allow VSD to conduct timely and reliable vaccine safety monitoring and evaluations.\nTop of Page\nHow Can I Access VSD Data?\nFrom time to time, scientists (from outside CDC and outside the VSD network) are interested in using data from the VSD to look differently at vaccine safety questions. When possible, CDC tries to accommodate these requests. Depending on the study, interested researchers may be able to access VSD data and data from VSD publications through public use datasets, the VSD data sharing program, and collaboration with current VSD investigators.\nTop of Page\nRelated Links\nVaccine Safety Information for Healthcare Providers\nEnsuring Vaccine Safety\nVaccine Safety Research\nReporting Adverse Events\nGet Email Updates\nTo receive email updates about this page, enter your email address:\nEnter Email Address\nWhat's this?\nSubmit\nWhat's this?\nSubmit Button\nFile Formats Help:How do I view different file formats (PDF, DOC, PPT, MPEG) on this site?\nAdobe PDF file\nMicrosoft PowerPoint file\nMicrosoft Word file\nMicrosoft Excel file\nAudio/Video file\nApple Quicktime file\nRealPlayer file\nText file\nZip Archive file\nSAS file\nePub file\nRIS file\nPage last reviewed: October 27, 2015\nPage last updated: May 13, 2016\nContent source:\nCenters for Disease Control and PreventionNational Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases (NCEZID)Division of Healthcare Quality Promotion (DHQP)\nEmail\nRecommend\nTweet\nYouTube\nInstagram\nListen\nWatch\nRSS\nABOUT\nAbout CDC\nJobs\nFunding\nLEGAL\nPolicies\nPrivacy\nFOIA\nNo Fear Act\nOIG\n1600 Clifton Road\nAtlanta,\nGA\n30329-4027\nUSA\n800-CDC-INFO (800-232-4636),\nTTY: 888-232-6348\nEmail CDC-INFO\nU.S. Department of Health & Human Services\nHHS/Open\nUSA.gov\nTop"
