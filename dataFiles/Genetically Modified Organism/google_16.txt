Genetic manipulation gives scientists the ability to create any new trait they wish, or suppress natural traits they dont want. Genetic manipulation typically involves introducing genetic attributes to a host that are not from the host. For example, splicing genetic information from fish into corn. By definition, genetic manipulation is unnatural and the traits created by these radical alterations would likely never evolve naturally. In my opinion, toying with genetics is extremely dangerous and may affect your health; its already affected the economy, the way the farm industry operates, and the worlds food supply.\nWere Being Kept in the Dark\nIn the United States, roughly 70% of processed foods contain GMOs and up to 80% of the crops grown are GMO. Corn, followed by soybeans, has become the most prevalent crop in the United States. This is not because corn on the cob, kernel corn, or creamed corn has become immensely popular. It is because the biochemical industry has significantly altered and monopolized corn production and the food industry uses corn in a way to create food the same way nurdles are used to create plastic goods. Corn in barbecue sauce? Yes, check the label.\nDespite the influx of GMO crops, its often not clear which consumables have been genetically manipulated. This is because currently, in the United States, food companies are not required to tell you if their products contain GMOs. The federal government has declared its their choice, not yours, to know whats in the food you eat.\nGMOs are Bad for the World\nAgro-chemical companies are seeking financial domination and GMOs are the ticket. When companies create GMO crops, the crops are no longer natural plants; they become the intellectual property of the companies that own them. This allows companies like Monsanto to control the worlds food supply by owning the genetic makeup and seeds of all crops grown. Farmers can no longer simply grow crops, they have to grow Monsantos crops and pay Monsanto for the privilege, negatively affecting humanity and the economy.\nFurthermore, Monsanto and AstraZeneca have developed copy-protection-like traits, dubbed Genetic Use Restriction Technology (T-GURT), which can cause plants to produce sterile seeds (meaning farmers have to buy seeds and cannot harvest their own). And, even if this is not used, many biochemical companies require farmers to sign agreements that they will not save any of their seeds for re-planting. Essentially, farm management has been taken away from farmers and given, on a silver platter, to multinational conglomerate corporations.\nEven worse, GMOs are bred to contain fewer natural traits, including defense mechanisms, and require more pesticides and herbicides. For example, if youve ever heard the phrase Roundup Ready it means the crop in question has been bred to resist endless amounts of Monsantos well-known poison- Roundup. Unfortunately, the increased use of chemicals has also lead to super bug and weed strains that cannot be controlled at all.\nThe Health Dangers of GMO Foods\nThe problem with GMO foods extends well beyond the environmental, philosophical, and economical horrors. GMO foods raise significant health concerns and have since 1992 when Calgene introduced the Flavr Savr, the first genetically modified tomato that the FDA approved for use in 1994  without requiring labeling. Even more troubling, the government decided that because the Flavr Savr performed so well in tests that its results would stand for any GMO produce and no further testing would be required before presenting it to consumers. The problem? The FDA suppressed reports describing deaths and stomach lesions in rats that had eaten the Flavr Savr. The Flavr Savr failure has not been an isolated incident.\nA study of people in the Philippines reported that their bodies developed antibodies to Bt toxin, meaning their body processed engineered traits and reacted to them. The same consumers of the GMO corn in the Philippines developed a resistance to ampicillin. Antibiotic resistance is something that science hadnt counted on, which is indicative of questionable experimentation. It makes me wonder if there is a bigger picture at hand. Maybe to create more illness and sell you more pharmaceuticals?\nIn 1996, it was shown that genes spliced from Brazil nuts into soybeans produced severe allergic reaction dangers, including anaphylactic shock which could lead to death.\nGMOs are a black eye on America and some other countries want nothing to do with them. In 2006, Japan suspended long grain rice imports from the US after tests revealed that the rice contained trace amounts of GMO that were not approved for human consumption.\nHow to Eliminate Toxic Genetically Modified Foods From Your Diet\nEat natural foods. Shop at your local farmers market. The majority of your food should not be packaged or include a barcode.\nEat organically grown fruit and vegetables. Organic crops are grown using no genetic modification, toxic pesticides, or herbicides.\nBe specifically vigilant about only choosing organic varieties of popcorn and corn. Most corn has been extensively modified.\nIf youre not in close proximity to industrial plants or bioengineered farms, start your own organic garden.\nIf you consume meat or dairy, only choose hormone and antibiotic-free, organic, range-fed products.\nAvoid canola oil and cottonseed oil; use organic grape seed oil, virgin coconut oil, hempseed oil, or olive oil instead.\nTake action. Let your elected officials and grocery executives know that you want GMO free foods to be available and promoted.\nAvoid GMOs\nCorn, soy, alfalfa (fed to cows), canola, and sugar beets are among the top grown GMO crops. Its also worth mentioning that with regard to sugar beets, over half the sugar beets grown are GMO and 90% of the sugar consumed in America comes from sugar beets- another reason to avoid sugar. Its up to you to do your own research. I recommend visiting the Center for Food Safety for a comprehensive list of foods and brands that contain GMOs.\nResults may vary.

The economical damages are clear, but your body breaks food down into its base components before it can enter the blood, you can not absorb genetic traits, its a physical impossibility.\nDrM\nNaturalpaths are not real doctors peopleno med school, no internship,no real science.\nbelieveinscience\nWhat is your source for the allegation that gmos\ncaused stomach lesions in rats?
