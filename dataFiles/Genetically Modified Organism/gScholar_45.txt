AbstractRecent controversies about genetically modified foods in the United Kingdom and several other European countries highlight the apparent differences that exist in public opinion on this subject across the Atlantic. Why are people in the United States seemingly untroubled by a technology that causes Europeans so many difficulties? The results of survey research on public perceptions of biotechnology in Europe and the United States during 19961997, together with an analysis of press coverage and policy formation from 1984 to 1996, can help to answer this question.* To whom correspondence should be addressed.
