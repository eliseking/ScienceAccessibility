Currently, labelling of genetically modified foods containing detectable transgenic material is required by EU legislation. A proposed package of legislation would extend this labelling to foods without any traces of transgenics. These new legislations would also impose labelling and a traceability system based on documentation throughout the food and feed manufacture system. The regulatory issues of risk analysis and labelling are currently harmonised by Codex Alimentarius. The implementation and maintenance of the regulations necessitates sampling protocols and analytical methodologies that allow for accurate determination of the content of genetically modified organisms within a food and feed sample. Current methodologies for the analysis of genetically modified organisms are focused on either one of two targets, the transgenic DNA inserted- or the novel protein(s) expressed- in a genetically modified product. For most DNA-based detection methods, the polymerase chain reaction is employed. Items that need consideration in the use of DNA-based detection methods include the specificity, sensitivity, matrix effects, internal reference DNA, availability of external reference materials, hemizygosity versus homozygosity, extrachromosomal DNA, and international harmonisation. For most protein-based methods, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays with antibodies binding the novel protein are employed. Consideration should be given to the selection of the antigen bound by the antibody, accuracy, validation, and matrix effects. Currently, validation of detection methods for analysis of genetically modified organisms is taking place. In addition, new methodologies are developed, including the use of microarrays, mass spectrometry, and surface plasmon resonance. Challenges for GMO detection include the detection of transgenic material in materials with varying chromosome numbers. The existing and proposed regulatory EU requirements for traceability of genetically modified products fit within a broader tendency towards traceability of foods in general and, commercially, towards products that can be distinguished from each other. Traceability systems document the history of a product and may serve the purpose of both marketing and health protection. In this framework, segregation and identity preservation systems allow for the separation of genetically modified and non-modified products from farm to fork. Implementation of these systems comes with specific technical requirements for each particular step of the food processing chain. In addition, the feasibility of traceability systems depends on a number of factors, including unique identifiers for each genetically modified product, detection methods, permissible levels of contamination, and financial costs. In conclusion, progress has been achieved in the field of sampling, detection, and traceability of genetically modified products, while some issues remain to be solved. For success, much will depend on the threshold level for adventitious contamination set by legislation.KeywordsTraceability; Detection methods; Sampling; RegulationAbbreviationsCaMV, cauliflower mosaic virus; CEN, Comit Europen de Normalisation; Cry1Ab, an insecticidal crystal protein from Bacillus thuringiensis; DNA, deoxyribonucleic acid; E. coli, Escherichia coli; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; EN, European standard; ENGL, European Network of GMO Laboratories; ENTRANSFOOD, European network safety assessment of genetically modified food crops; EPSPS, enolpyruvylshikimate phosphate synthase; EU, European Union; F&F, proposal of the European Commission for a regulation on GM food and feed; FAO, Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations; FRET, Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer; GM, genetically modified; GMO, genetically modified organism; HACCP, hazard analysis and critical control points; IP, identity preservation; ISO, International Organisation for Standardisation; ISTA, International Seed Testing Association; JRC, Joint Research Centre; KELDA, Kernel Lot Distribution Assessment Project; LOD, limit of detection; LOQ, limit of quantitation; MALDI, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation; MS, mass spectroscopy; OECD, Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; QPCRGMOFOOD, EU project on reliable, standardised, specific, quantitative detection of genetically modified foods; RNA, ribonucleic acid; SNP, single nucleotide polymorphism; SPR, surface plasmon resonance; T&L, proposal of the European Commission for a regulation on traceability on labelling of GMOs and products obtained from GMOs; TC, technical committee; TILLING, technique for targeting induced local lesions in genomes; TOF, time of flight; UK, United Kingdom; US, United States of America; USDA/GIPSA, Grain Inspection, Packers, and Stockyards Administration of the US Department of Agriculture; UV, ultraviolet; WHO, World Health Organisation of the United Nations1. IntroductionIssues related to detection and traceability of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) are gaining world wide interest due to the ever-increasing global diffusion and the related socio-economical implications. The interest of the scientific community into traceability aspects has increased simultaneously.Progress, both in sampling and detection methodologies and in traceability strategies, strongly influences the potential for adequate implementation and maintenance of legislation and labelling requirements. Crucial factors in this respect are the numbers of the GMOs involved and international agreement on traceability. The availability of reliable traceability strategies may increase public trust in transparency in GMO issues.The detection and identification of GMOs represents a relatively new area of diagnostics in which much progress has already been achieved with DNA- and protein-based methods. In this paper, the section dealing with the detection highlights the current state of the art of the methodology. In addition, it also indicates current needs and limitations that hamper further developments in the area of GMO detection. Obvious needs are (1) information on GMOs developed worldwide, (2) availability of material for stated purposes, and (3) transparency of information.The paper also deals with new diagnostic methodologies, such as the microarray-based methods that allow for the simultaneous identification of the increasing number of GMOs on the global market in a single sample (some of these techniques have also been discussed for the detection of unintended effects of genetic modification by Cellini et al., 2004). Emphasis is also given to the quality assurance of the analytical data represented by the adequate availability of suitable Certified Reference Materials for different applications and the need for harmonised guidelines for validation studies.
