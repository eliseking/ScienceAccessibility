Quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) affinity biosensor for genetically modified organisms (GMOs) detectionIlaria Mannelli, Maria Minunni, , Sara Tombelli, Marco Mascini Dipartimento di Chimica, Universit degli Studi di Firenze, Polo Scientifico-Via della Lastruccia 3, Sesto Fiorentino-Florence 50019, ItalyReceived 5 October 2001, Accepted 8 May 2002, Available online 2 December 2002AbstractA DNA piezoelectric sensor has been developed for the detection of genetically modified organisms (GMOs). Single stranded DNA (ssDNA) probes were immobilised on the sensor surface of a quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) device and the hybridisation between the immobilised probe and the target complementary sequence in solution was monitored. The probe sequences were internal to the sequence of the 35S promoter (P) and Nos terminator (T), which are inserted sequences in the genome of GMOs regulating the transgene expression. Two different probe immobilisation procedures were applied: (a) a thioldextran procedure and (b) a thiol-derivatised probe and blocking thiol procedure. The system has been optimised using synthetic oligonucleotides, which were then applied to samples of plasmidic and genomic DNA isolated from the pBI121 plasmid, certified reference materials (CRM), and real samples amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The analytical parameters of the sensor have been investigated (sensitivity, reproducibility, lifetime etc.). The results obtained showed that both immobilisation procedures enabled sensitive and specific detection of GMOs, providing a useful tool for screening analysis in food samples.KeywordsQCM; GMO; Immobilisation procedure1. IntroductionQuartz crystal microbalance (QCM) devices have been extensively applied as transducers in biosensing. In particular, in affinity sensing they have been used in interactions based on immunochemical reactions and also in hybridisation reactions between two complementary nucleic acid strands. Immuno- and DNA sensors based on QCM have been applied with success to real problems from environmental to clinical analysis (Caruso et al., 1997, Fawcett et al., 1998, Cavic and Thompson, 2000, Tombelli et al., 2000aandTombelli et al., 2000b).In particular, DNA-based sensors have been presented as alternatives to gel electrophoresis and to traditional methods for specific DNA sequences detection, where labelled (using radioisotope like 32P or fluorescent tags) probes are required. Using QCM sensing, with an appropriate DNA probe immobilised on the sensor surface, it is possible to detect a specific target sequence in solution. DNA-based sensing is often coupled with the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to increase the sensitivity of the system.The fields of application of such a system are various. A frequent analytical problem is the control of food containing transgenic material.A genetically modified organism (GMO) is referred to as a living organism whose genome has been modified by the introduction of an exogenous gene able to express an additional protein that confers new characteristics, i.e. herbicide tolerance (Niederhauser et al., 1996, Vollenhofer et al., 1999andHails, 2000) or resistance to virus (Hails, 2000), antibiotic (Drge et al., 1998) and insect (Vollenhofer et al., 1999, Hails, 2000, Mariotti et al., 2002andMinunni et al., 2001).The foreign DNA is usually inserted in a gene cassette consisting of an expression promoter (P), a structural gene (encoding region) and an expression terminator (T) (Fig. 1). Two particular sequences are inserted in most of the available transgenic products: the promoter of the subunit 35S of ribosomal RNA of cauliflower mosaic virus (35S) and the TNos from Agrobacterium tumefaciens. In particular they are widely used for the production of many transgenic vegetables commercially available, as soy Roundup Ready, maize MaisGard and the tomato Flavr Savr.Fig. 1.(a) Schematic representation of a gene cassette, consisting of a promoter P, a structural gene (coding region) and a terminator T; (b) two cassettes integrated into the host genome.Figure optionsDownload full-size imageDownload as PowerPoint slideMany countries have developed laws controlling the marketing of GMOs. In the EU the Directive 90/220 regulates the approval and the release of GMOs. Labelling of the genetically modified organism is not mandatory in US, but in Europe the novel food regulation will require the labelling of GM products (Regulation (EC), 1997). At present, in the EU, labelling is mandatory for foodstuff containing ingredients derived from genetically modified maize (the Bt-Maize from Novartis) and soybean (RR-Soy from Monsanto) in percentage higher than 1% (Council Regulation (EC), 2000).There are some analytical procedures already available for GMO detection, involving two approaches based on detection of exogenous DNA and proteins, respectively (European Commission, 1998, Anklam, 1999, Gachet et al., 1999, Lipp et al., 1999, Meyer, 1999, Van Duijn et al., 1999, Vollenhofer et al., 1999, Erickson, 2000, Minunni et al., 2000, Berdal and Holst-Jensen, 2001, Hernndez et al., 2001andLipp et al., 2001). One method for the detection of transgenic material at DNA level has been already validated; it refers to the detection of P35S and TNos in flour samples (Pietsch et al., 1997). This method associates the amplification by PCR with gel electrophoresis, which does not give any sequence information and employs toxic reagents. More recently quantitative methods for transgenic DNA detection have been studied; some results have been reported (Studer et al., 1998andGatti et al., 1999) using the real-time PCR approach.On the basis of the interesting performances of QCM DNA-sensors and on the need of new, fast and sensitive analytical methods for GMO screening, we set up a new sensor for GMO detection in food matrices.The sensing is based on 10 MHz piezoelectric crystals sandwiched between gold electrodes. The detection principle allows label-free DNA hybridisation determination in few minutes. A probe, specific for the target sequence, is immobilised on the sensor surface and the sample (the PCR-amplified product) is free in solution. The sample solution is deposited on the sensing surface and the interaction with the immobilised probe is observed in real-time. For the immobilisation of the probe, a dedicated chemistry has been developed in the last few years (Storri et al., 1998a, Storri et al., 1998bandTombelli and Mascini, 2000) to reduce non-specific adsorption problems, arising from complex sample matrices, which could significantly affect the specificity and the sensitivity of the mass sensor.For probe immobilisation two different chemistries have been studied. The sensor has been first optimised using as probes biotinylated oligonucleotides, immobilised onto streptavidin coated gold electrodes (Tombelli et al., 2000aandStorri et al., 1998b).The second immobilisation procedure, developed to reduce the time required for the surface modification is based on the direct coupling of thiol-derivatised oligonucleotide probes (Probe-C6-SH) to the gold electrodes. A blocking thiol (6-mercapto-1-hexanol, MCH) was also used (Herne and Tarlov, 1997).In both coating procedures the immobilised oligonucleotides were complementary to characteristic sequences present in GMOs. The hybridisation reaction between the immobilised probe and the target sequence present in solution is then observed. Control experiments with non-complementary sequences were also performed to evaluate the specificity of the system. The hybridisation study was also performed with samples of DNA isolated from certified reference materials (CRM), soybean powder, and real samples from different origins, which were amplified by PCR. The analytical parameters of the sensor have been investigated (sensitivity, reproducibility, lifetime, etc.).2. Materials and methods2.1. Apparatus, reagents and samplesTen megahertzs AT cut quartz crystals (14 mm) with gold electrodes (42.6 mm2 area) evaporated on both sides were obtained from Mistral, Latina, Italy.The quartz crystal was housed inside a methacrylate cell such that only one side of the crystal was in contact with the solution in the cell well. The frequency variations were continuously recorded using a quartz crystal analyser (Model QCA917, Seiko EG&G, Chiba, Japan): the data (the resonance frequency) is displayed on the main display screen and can be read directly by a computer connected to the QCA917 interface. The frequency shifts reported in the paper are the difference between two stable frequency values (1 Hz).
