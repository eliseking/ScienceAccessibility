Abstract. Numerous analytical methods, both qualitative and quantitative, have been developed to determine reliably the presence and/or the amount of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) in agricultural commodities, in raw agricultural materials and in processed and refined ingredients. In addition to the "classical" methods for DNA and protein analysis, e.g. polymerase chain reaction and enzyme linked immunosorbent analysis, certain types of GMO-containing matrices can be profiled by complementary chemical analysis methods such as chromatography and near infrared spectroscopy. This review summarises the status of the most widely used GMO analysis technologies, identifies new areas of analytical investigation and discusses current needs and future challenges.Genetically modified organisms Polymerase chain reaction Enzyme-linked immunosorbent analysis Chromatography Near infrared spectroscopyRevised version: 7 August 2001Electronic PublicationDownload to read the full article textCopyright informationSpringer-Verlag2001Authors and AffiliationsElkeAnklam1FerruccioGadani2PetraHeinze1HansPijnenburg2GuyVan Den Eede11.European Commission, Joint Research Centre, Institute for Health and Consumer Protection, Food Products and Consumer Goods Unit, I-21020 Ispra, ItalyItaly2.Philip Morris Europe, Research and Development, CH-2003 Neuchtel, SwitzerlandSwitzerland
