What are genetically modified (GM) organisms and GM foods?\nGenetically modified organisms (GMOs) can be defined as organisms (i.e. plants,\nanimals or microorganisms) in which the genetic material (DNA) has been altered in a\nway that does not occur naturally by mating and/or natural recombination. The\ntechnology is often called modern biotechnology or gene technology, sometimes\nalso recombinant DNA technology or genetic engineering. It allows selected\nindividual genes to be transferred from one organism into another, also between nonrelated\nspecies. Foods produced from or using GM organisms are often referred to as\nGM foods.\n2. Why are GM foods produced?\nGM foods are developed  and marketed  because there is some perceived advantage\neither to the producer or consumer of these foods. This is meant to translate into a\nproduct with a lower price, greater benefit (in terms of durability or nutritional value)\nor both. Initially GM seed developers wanted their products to be accepted by\nproducers and have concentrated on innovations that bring direct benefit to farmers\n(and the food industry generally).\nOne of the objectives for developing plants based on GM organisms is to improve\ncrop protection. The GM crops currently on the market are mainly aimed at an\nincreased level of crop protection through the introduction of resistance against plant\ndiseases caused by insects or viruses or through increased tolerance towards\nherbicides.\nResistance against insects is achieved by incorporating into the food plant the gene for\ntoxin production from the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt). This toxin is\ncurrently used as a conventional insecticide in agriculture and is safe for human\nconsumption. GM crops that inherently produce this toxin have been shown to require\nlower quantities of insecticides in specific situations, e.g. where pest pressure is high.\nVirus resistance is achieved through the introduction of a gene from certain viruses\nwhich cause disease in plants. Virus resistance makes plants less susceptible to\ndiseases caused by such viruses, resulting in higher crop yields.\nHerbicide tolerance is achieved through the introduction of a gene from a bacterium\nconveying resistance to some herbicides. In situations where weed pressure is high,\nthe use of such crops has resulted in a reduction in the quantity of the herbicides used.\n3. Is the safety of GM foods assessed differently from conventional foods?\nGenerally consumers consider that conventional foods (that have an established\nrecord of safe consumption over the history) are safe. Whenever novel varieties of\norganisms for food use are developed using the traditional breeding methods that had\nexisted before the introduction of gene technology, some of the characteristics of\norganisms may be altered, either in a positive or a negative way. National food\nauthorities may be called upon to examine the safety of such conventional foods\nobtained from novel varieties of organisms, but this is not always the case.\nIn contrast, most national authorities consider that specific assessments are necessary\nfor GM foods. Specific systems have been set up for the rigorous evaluation of GM\norganisms and GM foods relative to both human health and the environment. Similar\nevaluations are generally not performed for conventional foods. Hence there currently\nexists a significant difference in the evaluation process prior to marketing for these\ntwo groups of food.\nThe WHO Department of Food Safety and Zoonoses aims at assisting national\nauthorities in the identification of foods that should be subject to risk assessment and\nto recommend appropriate approaches to safety assessment. Should national\nauthorities decide to conduct safety assessment of GM organisms, WHO recommends\nthe use of Codex Alimentarius guidelines (See the answer to Question 11 below).\n4. How is a safety assessment of GM food conducted?\nThe safety assessment of GM foods generally focuses on: (a) direct health effects\n(toxicity), (b) potential to provoke allergic reaction (allergenicity); (c) specific\ncomponents thought to have nutritional or toxic properties; (d) the stability of the\ninserted gene; (e) nutritional effects associated with genetic modification; and (f) any\nunintended effects which could result from the gene insertion.\n5. What are the main issues of concern for human health?\nWhile theoretical discussions have covered a broad range of aspects, the three main\nissues debated are the potentials to provoke allergic reaction (allergenicity), gene\ntransfer and outcrossing.\nAllergenicity\nAs a matter of principle, the transfer of genes from commonly\nallergenic organisms to non-allergic organisms is discouraged unless it can be\ndemonstrated that the protein product of the transferred gene is not allergenic. While\nfoods developed using traditional breeding methods are not generally tested for\nallergenicity, protocols for the testing of GM foods have been evaluated by the Food\nand Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and WHO. No allergic\neffects have been found relative to GM foods currently on the market.\nGene transfer\nGene transfer from GM foods to cells of the body or to bacteria in the\ngastrointestinal tract would cause concern if the transferred genetic material adversely\naffects human health. This would be particularly relevant if antibiotic resistance\ngenes, used as markers when creating GMOs, were to be transferred. Although the\nprobability of transfer is low, the use of gene transfer technology that does not involve\nantibiotic resistance genes is encouraged.\nOutcrossing\nThe migration of genes from GM plants into conventional crops or\nrelated species in the wild (referred to as outcrossing), as well as the mixing of\ncrops derived from conventional seeds with GM crops, may have an indirect effect on\nfood safety and food security. Cases have been reported where GM crops approved\nfor animal feed or industrial use were detected at low levels in the products intended\nfor human consumption. Several countries have adopted strategies to reduce mixing,\nincluding a clear separation of the fields within which GM crops and conventional\ncrops are grown.\n6. How is a risk assessment for the environment performed?\nEnvironmental risk assessments cover both the GMO concerned and the potential\nreceiving environment. The assessment process includes evaluation of the\ncharacteristics of the GMO and its effect and stability in the environment, combined\nwith ecological characteristics of the environment in which the introduction will take\nplace. The assessment also includes unintended effects which could result from the\ninsertion of the new gene.\n7. What are the issues of concern for the environment?\nIssues of concern include: the capability of the GMO to escape and potentially\nintroduce the engineered genes into wild populations; the persistence of the gene after\nthe GMO has been harvested; the susceptibility of non-target organisms (e.g. insects\nwhich are not pests) to the gene product; the stability of the gene; the reduction in the\nspectrum of other plants including loss of biodiversity; and increased use of chemicals\nin agriculture. The environmental safety aspects of GM crops vary considerably\naccording to local conditions.\n8. Are GM foods safe?\nDifferent GM organisms include different genes inserted in different ways. This\nmeans that individual GM foods and their safety should be assessed on a case-by-case\nbasis and that it is not possible to make general statements on the safety of all GM\nfoods.\nGM foods currently available on the international market have passed safety\nassessments and are not likely to present risks for human health. In addition, no\neffects on human health have been shown as a result of the consumption of such foods\nby the general population in the countries where they have been approved.\nContinuous application of safety assessments based on the Codex Alimentarius\nprinciples and, where appropriate, adequate post market monitoring, should form the\nbasis for ensuring the safety of GM foods.\n9. How are GM foods regulated nationally?\nThe way governments have regulated GM foods varies. In some countries GM foods\nare not yet regulated. Countries which have legislation in place focus primarily on\nassessment of risks for consumer health. Countries which have regulatory provisions for GM foods usually also regulate GMOs in general, taking into account health and\nenvironmental risks, as well as control- and trade-related issues (such as potential\ntesting and labelling regimes). In view of the dynamics of the debate on GM foods,\nlegislation is likely to continue to evolve.\n10. What kind of GM foods are on the market internationally?\nGM crops available on the international market today have been designed using one\nof three basic traits: resistance to insect damage; resistance to viral infections; and\ntolerance towards certain herbicides. GM crops with higher nutrient content (e.g.\nsoybeans increased oleic acid) have been also studied recently.\n11. What happens when GM foods are traded internationally?\nThe Codex Alimentarius Commission (Codex) is the joint FAO/WHO\nintergovernmental body responsible for developing the standards, codes of practice,\nguidelines and recommendations that constitute the Codex Alimentarius, meaning the\ninternational food code. Codex developed principles for the human health risk\nanalysis of GM foods in 2003.\nPrinciples for the risk analysis of foods derived from modern biotechnology\nThe premise of these principles sets out a premarket assessment, performed on a caseby-\ncase basis and including an evaluation of both direct effects (from the inserted\ngene) and unintended effects (that may arise as a consequence of insertion of the new\ngene) Codex also developed three Guidelines:\nGuideline for the conduct of food safety assessment of foods derived from recombinant-DNA plants\nGuideline for the conduct of food safety assessment of foods produced using recombinant-DNA microorganisms\nGuideline for the conduct of food safety assessment of foods derived from recombinant-DNA animals\nCodex principles do not have a binding effect on national legislation, but are referred\nto specifically in the Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary\nMeasures of the World Trade Organization (SPS Agreement), and WTO Members are\nencouraged to harmonize national standards with Codex standards. If trading partners\nhave the same or similar mechanisms for the safety assessment of GM foods, the\npossibility that one product is approved in one country but rejected in another\nbecomes smaller.\nThe Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety, an environmental treaty legally binding for its\nParties which took effect in 2003, regulates transboundary movements of Living\nModified Organisms (LMOs). GM foods are within the scope of the Protocol only if\nthey contain LMOs that are capable of transferring or replicating genetic material. The\ncornerstone of the Protocol is a requirement that exporters seek consent from\nimporters before the first shipment of LMOs intended for release into the\nenvironment.\n12. Have GM products on the international market passed a safety assessment?\nThe GM products that are currently on the international market have all passed safety\nassessments conducted by national authorities. These different assessments in general follow the same basic principles, including an assessment of environmental and\nhuman health risk. The food safety assessment is usually based on Codex documents.\n13. Why has there been concern about GM foods among some politicians, public interest groups and consumers?\nSince the first introduction on the market in the mid-1990s of a major GM food\n(herbicide-resistant soybeans), there has been concern about such food among\npoliticians, activists and consumers, especially in Europe. Several factors are\ninvolved. In the late 1980s  early 1990s, the results of decades of molecular research\nreached the public domain. Until that time, consumers were generally not very aware\nof the potential of this research. In the case of food, consumers started to wonder\nabout safety because they perceive that modern biotechnology is leading to the\ncreation of new species.\nConsumers frequently ask, what is in it for me?. Where medicines are concerned,\nmany consumers more readily accept biotechnology as beneficial for their health (e.g.\nvaccines, medicines with improved treatment potential or increased safety). In the\ncase of the first GM foods introduced onto the European market, the products were of\nno apparent direct benefit to consumers (not significantly cheaper, no increased shelflife,\nno better taste). The potential for GM seeds to result in bigger yields per\ncultivated area should lead to lower prices. However, public attention has focused on\nthe risk side of the risk-benefit equation, often without distinguishing between\npotential environmental impacts and public health effects of GMOs.\nConsumer confidence in the safety of food supplies in Europe has decreased\nsignificantly as a result of a number of food scares that took place in the second half\nof the 1990s that are unrelated to GM foods. This has also had an impact on\ndiscussions about the acceptability of GM foods. Consumers have questioned the\nvalidity of risk assessments, both with regard to consumer health and environmental\nrisks, focusing in particular on long-term effects. Other topics debated by consumer\norganizations have included allergenicity and antimicrobial resistance. Consumer\nconcerns have triggered a discussion on the desirability of labelling GM foods,\nallowing for an informed choice of consumers.\n14. What is the state of public debate on GMOs?\nThe release of GMOs into the environment and the marketing of GM foods have\nresulted in a public debate in many parts of the world. This debate is likely to\ncontinue, probably in the broader context of other uses of biotechnology (e.g. in\nhuman medicine) and their consequences for human societies. Even though the issues\nunder debate are usually very similar (costs and benefits, safety issues), the outcome\nof the debate differs from country to country. On issues such as labelling and\ntraceability of GM foods as a way to address consumer preferences, there is no\nworldwide consensus to date. Despite the lack of consensus on these topics, the\nCodex Alimentarius Commission has made significant progress and developed Codex\ntexts relevant to labelling of foods derived from modern biotechnology in 2011 to\nensure consistency on any approach on labelling implemented by Codex members\nwith already adopted Codex provisions.\n15. Are peoples reactions related to the different attitudes to food in various regions of the world?\nDepending on the region of the world, people often have different attitudes to food. In\naddition to nutritional value, food often has societal and historical connotations, and\nin some instances may have religious importance. Technological modification of food\nand food production may evoke a negative response among consumers, especially in\nthe absence of sound risk communication on risk assessment efforts and cost/benefit\nevaluations.\n16. Are there implications for the rights of farmers to own their crops?\nYes, intellectual property rights are likely to be an element in the debate on GM foods,\nwith an impact on the rights of farmers. In the FAO/WHO expert consultation in 2003\n(http://www.who.int/entity/foodsafety/biotech/meetings/en/gmanimal_reportnov03_en\n.pdf), WHO and FAO have considered potential problems of the technological\ndivide and the unbalanced distribution of benefits and risks between developed and\ndeveloping countries and the problem often becomes even more acute through the\nexistence of intellectual property rights and patenting that places an advantage on the\nstrongholds of scientific and technological expertise. Such considerations are likely to\nalso affect the debate on GM foods.\n17. Why are certain groups concerned about the growing influence of the chemical industry on agriculture?\nCertain groups are concerned about what they consider to be an undesirable level of\ncontrol of seed markets by a few chemical companies. Sustainable agriculture and\nbiodiversity benefit most from the use of a rich variety of crops, both in terms of good\ncrop protection practices as well as from the perspective of society at large and the\nvalues attached to food. These groups fear that as a result of the interest of the\nchemical industry in seed markets, the range of varieties used by farmers may be\nreduced mainly to GM crops. This would impact on the food basket of a society as\nwell as in the long run on crop protection (for example, with the development of\nresistance against insect pests and tolerance of certain herbicides). The exclusive use\nof herbicide-tolerant GM crops would also make the farmer dependent on these\nchemicals. These groups fear a dominant position of the chemical industry in\nagricultural development, a trend which they do not consider to be sustainable.\n18. What further developments can be expected in the area of GMOs?\nFuture GM organisms are likely to include plants with improved resistance against\nplant disease or drought, crops with increased nutrient levels, fish species with\nenhanced growth characteristics. For non-food use, they may include plants or\nanimals producing pharmaceutically important proteins such as new vaccines.\n19. What has WHO been doing to improve the evaluation of GM foods?\nWHO has been taking an active role in relation to GM foods, primarily for two\nreasons:\non the grounds that public health could benefit from the potential of\nbiotechnology, for example, from an increase in the nutrient content of foods,\ndecreased allergenicity and more efficient and/or sustainable food production; and\nbased on the need to examine the potential negative effects on human health\nof the consumption of food produced through genetic modification in order to protect public health. Modern technologies should be thoroughly evaluated if they are to\nconstitute a true improvement in the way food is produced.\nWHO, together with FAO, has convened several expert consultations on the\nevaluation of GM foods and provided technical advice for the Codex Alimentarius\nCommission which was fed into the Codex Guidelines on safety assessment of GM\nfoods. WHO will keep paying due attention to the safety of GM foods from the view\nof public health protection, in close collaboration with FAO and other international\nbodies.\nDownload the frequently asked questions on genetically modified foodspdf, 90kb\nYou are here:\nFood safety\nAreas of work\nFood technologies\nQuick Links\nSitemap\nHome\nHealth topics\nData\nMedia centre\nPublications\nCountries\nProgrammes and projects\nGovernance\nAbout\nWHO\nHelp and Services\nContacts\nFAQs\nEmployment\nFeedback\nPrivacy\nE-mail scams\nWHO Regional Offices\nWHO African Region\nWHO Region of the Americas\nWHO South-East Asia Region\nWHO European Region\nWHO Eastern Mediterranean Region\nWHO Western Pacific Region\n\nWHO 2017\nBack to top\nEmail Address\nSign up for WHO updates'
