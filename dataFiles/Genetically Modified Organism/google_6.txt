In conventional livestock production, crop farming, and even pet breeding, it has long been the practice to breed select individuals of a species in order to produce offspring that have desirable traits. In genetic modification, however, recombinant genetic technologies are employed to produce organisms whose genomes have been precisely altered at the molecular level, usually by the inclusion of genes from unrelated species of organisms that code for traits that would not be obtained easily through conventional selective breeding.Genetically modified (GM) barley grown by researchers on a site belonging to Giessen University Ralph Orlowski/Getty ImagesGMOs are produced through using scientific methods that include recombinant DNA technology and reproductive cloning. In reproductive cloning, a nucleus is extracted from a cell of the individual to be cloned and is inserted into the enucleated cytoplasm of a host egg. The process results in the generation of an offspring that is genetically identical to the donor individual. The first animal produced by means of this cloning technique with a nucleus from an adult donor cell (as opposed to a donor embryo) was a sheep named Dolly, born in 1996. Since then a number of other animals, including pigs, horses, and dogs, have been generated by reproductive cloning technology. Recombinant DNA technology, on the other hand, involves the insertion of one or more individual genes from an organism of one species into the DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) of another. Whole-genome replacement, involving the transplantation of one bacterial genome into the cell body, or cytoplasm, of another microorganism, has been reported, although this technology is still limited to basic scientific applications.Genetically modified organisms are produced using scientific methods that include recombinant DNA Encyclopdia Britannica, Inc.\nSimilar Topics\nDNA sequencing\ngene editing\nrecombinant DNA technology\nwhole genome sequencing\nGMOs produced through genetic technologies have become a part of everyday life, entering into society through agriculture, medicine, research, and environmental management. However, while GMOs have benefited human society in many ways, some disadvantages exist; therefore, the production of GMOs remains a highly controversial topic in many parts of the world.GMOs in agricultureGenetically modified (GM) foods were first approved for human consumption in the United States in 1994, and by 201415 about 90 percent of the corn, cotton, and soybeans planted in the United States were GM. By the end of 2010, GM crops covered more than 10 million square kilometres (3.86 million square miles) of land in 29 countries worldwideone-tenth of the worlds farmland. The majority of GM crops were grown in the Americas.Genetically modified corn (maize). S74/Shutterstock.comEngineered crops can dramatically increase per area crop yields and, in some cases, reduce the use of chemical insecticides. For example, the application of wide-spectrum insecticides declined in many areas growing plants, such as potatoes, cotton, and corn, that were endowed with a gene from the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis, which produces a natural insecticide called Bt toxin. Field studies conducted in India in which Bt cotton was compared with non-Bt cotton demonstrated a 3080 percent increase in yield from the GM crop. This increase was attributed to marked improvement in the GM plants ability to overcome bollworm infestation, which was otherwise common. Studies of Bt cotton production in Arizona, U.S., demonstrated only small gains in yieldabout 5 percentwith an estimated cost reduction of $25$65 (USD) per acre owing to decreased pesticide applications. In China, where farmers first gained access to Bt cotton in 1997, the GM crop was initially successful. Farmers who had planted Bt cotton reduced their pesticide use by 5080 percent and increased their earnings by as much as 36 percent. By 2004, however, farmers who had been growing Bt cotton for several years found that the benefits of the crop eroded as populations of secondary insect pests, such as mirids, increased. Farmers once again were forced to spray broad-spectrum pesticides throughout the growing season, such that the average revenue for Bt growers was 8 percent lower than that of farmers who grew conventional cotton. Meanwhile, Bt resistance had also evolved in field populations of major cotton pests, including both the cotton bollworm (Helicoverpa armigera) and the pink bollworm (Pectinophora gossypiella).\nBritannica Stories\nIn The News / Health & Medicine\nNASA Twins Study Provides Glimpse into Impacts of Space Travel\nDemystified / Music\nIs the Piano a Percussion or a Stringed Instrument?\nSpotlight / History\nNostradamus and His Prophecies\nIn The News / Society\nBoy Scouts Reverse Policy on Transgender Members\nOther GM plants were engineered for resistance to a specific chemical herbicide, rather than resistance to a natural predator or pest. Herbicide-resistant crops (HRC) have been available since the mid-1980s; these crops enable effective chemical control of weeds, since only the HRC plants can survive in fields treated with the corresponding herbicide. Many HRCs are resistant to glyphosate (Roundup), enabling liberal application of the chemical, which is highly effective against weeds. Such crops have been especially valuable for no-till farming, which helps prevent soil erosion. However, because HRCs encourage increased application of chemicals to the soil, rather than decreased application, they remain controversial with regard to their environmental impact. In addition, in order to reduce the risk of selecting for herbicide-resistant weeds, farmers must use multiple diverse weed-management strategies.\nTest Your Knowledge\nEarth: Fact or Fiction?\nAnother example of a GM crop is golden rice, which originally was intended for Asia and was genetically modified to produce almost 20 times the beta-carotene of previous varieties. Golden rice was created by modifying the rice genome to include a gene from the daffodil Narcissus pseudonarcissus that produces an enzyme known as phyotene synthase and a gene from the bacterium Erwinia uredovora that produces an enzyme called phyotene desaturase. The introduction of these genes enabled beta-carotene, which is converted to vitamin A in the human liver, to accumulate in the rice endospermthe edible part of the rice plantthereby increasing the amount of beta-carotene available for vitamin A synthesis in the body. In 2004 the same researchers who developed the original golden rice plant improved upon the model, generating golden rice 2, which showed a 23-fold increase in carotenoid production.Another form of modified rice was generated to help combat iron deficiency, which impacts close to 30 percent of the world population. This GM crop was engineered by introducing into the rice genome a ferritin gene from the common bean, Phaseolus vulgaris, that produces a protein capable of binding iron, as well as a gene from the fungus Aspergillus fumigatus that produces an enzyme capable of digesting compounds that increase iron bioavailability via digestion of phytate (an inhibitor of iron absorption). The iron-fortified GM rice was engineered to overexpress an existing rice gene that produces a cysteine-rich metallothioneinlike (metal-binding) protein that enhances iron absorption.\nConnect with Britannica\nFacebook\nTwitter\nYouTube\nInstagram\nPinterest\nA variety of other crops modified to endure the weather extremes common in other parts of the globe are also in production.\nPage 1 of 2\nNext page\nGMOs in medicine and research\nMore about genetically modified organism (GMO)\n4 References found in Britannica ArticlesAssorted Referencesbiotechnology\n(in biotechnology)\nrecombinant DNA technology\n(in recombinant DNA technology: Genetically modified organisms)\ntrans fats\n(in trans fat: Trans-fat alternatives)\nAdditional Reading\nExternal Links\nEnvironmental Protection Agency - Licensing and Permitting - Genetically Modified Organism\nEuropean Food Safety Authority - Genetically Modified Organism\nArticle Contributors\nArticle History\nFeedback\nCorrections?
