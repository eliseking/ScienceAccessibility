AbstractGenetically modified Lactococcus lactis secreting
interleukin 10 provides a therapeutic approach for inflammatory bowel disease.
However, the release of such genetically modified organisms through clinical
use raises safety concerns. In an effort to address this problem, we replaced
the thymidylate synthase gene thyA of L. lactis with a synthetic
human IL10 gene. This thyA-hIL10+L. lactis strain produced human IL-10
(hIL-10), and when deprived of thymidine or thymine, its viability dropped by
several orders of magnitude, essentially preventing its accumulation in the
environment. The biological containment system and the bacterium's capacity to
secrete hIL-10 were validated in vivo in pigs. Our approach is a
promising one for transgene containment because, in the unlikely event that the
engineered L. lactis strain acquired an intact thyA gene from a
donor such as L. lactis subsp. cremoris, the transgene would be
eliminated from the genome.
IntroductionGenetically modified food-grade microorganisms provide a possible means
for targeting therapeutic proteins to the mucosa. By in situ synthesis,
genetically modified Lactococcus lactis can deliver mouse interleukin 2
(mIL-2) and mIL-6 to the upper airways1 and mIL-10 to the
intestine2. Streptococcus gordonii3 and
Lactobacillus zeae4 have been used in this way to deliver
single-chain antibodies. However, the use of genetically modified organisms in
medicine raises legitimate concerns about their survival and propagation in the
environment and about the dissemination of antibiotic selection markers or
other genetic modifications to other microorganisms.Delivery of the anti-inflammatory cytokine mIL-10 to the intestine by
genetically modified L. lactis cures or prevents experimental
enterocolitis in mice2. The mouse experimental colitis model
mimics the severe, chronic intestinal inflammation in humans known as
inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). IBD requires lifelong medication, so the
development of inexpensive, easily administered therapeutics with minimal side
effects is highly desirable. Although IL-10 is a good candidate for IBD
therapy5, the administration of IL-10 by injection induces side
effects6, 7, 8 that prohibit its long-term use at high
concentrations. This problem cannot be solved by delivery to the intestine, as
IL-10 is acid sensitive9, 10. Localized IL-10 synthesis by
genetically modified L. lactis may address these shortcomings.In this study we investigated a strategy for preventing escape into the
environment of the transgene and the genetically modified organism. The
thymidylate synthase gene, thyA, which is essential for the growth of
L. lactis, was replaced with the expression cassette for hIL10.
As expected, the resulting strain was dependent on thymidine or thymine for
growth and survival. We assessed the resulting genetically modified strains
in vitro and in pigs, animals whose digestive systems are very similar
to those of humans in both physiology and size. Transgene escape through
acquisition of an intact thyA gene is very unlikely and, in the event it
did occur, would recombine the transgene out of the genome, resulting in
reversion of the genetically modified organism to the unmodified state.Top of page
ResultsGene exchange between thyA and hIL10The sequence of the thyA gene in L. lactis MG1363 is
published11. We expected, from the literature on bacterial
recombination12, that the known flanking fragments were too short
to allow efficient crossover using our genetic modification protocol. We
therefore cloned the thyA locus with longer flanking sequences.
Comparison with the thyA locus of L. lactis IL1403 (ref.
13) showed that the two thyA sequences are
88% identical. The sequences upstream of thyA are completely unrelated
and a 1,276-bp sequence downstream from MG1363 thyA is absent in IL1403.
The putative rma1 genes further downstream from thyA is 86%
identical. We confirmed the structure of the MG1363 thyA locus by
Southern blot analysis (data not shown).We used conditionally nonreplicative plasmids14, in
which 1 kb of the regions upstream and downstream of MG1363 thyA flank a
series of hIL10 expression cassettes, for targeted gene exchange by
double homologous crossover (Fig. 1a). The structure of
the resulting L. lactis strains was confirmed by PCR (Fig. 1b), Southern blotting (Fig. 1c) and
DNA sequencing. The recombinant strains were called Thy11, Thy12, Thy15 and
Thy16 (Fig. 2a) and are here referred to collectively as
Thy1116. Growth of these strains was dependent on the addition of
thymidine or thymine to the growth medium, with a strong preference for
thymidine. Supplementation with 20 M thymidine allowed the cultures to grow
to full saturation, whereas thymine was 1,000-fold less effective (data
not shown).

1, 2 and 3 represent PCR primer pairs (F and R), designed in such a way that
PCR using primer pair 1 shows collinearity between chromosomal DNA located
5' of the target area and hIL10 (PCR1), that PCR using primer pair
2 shows collinearity between chromosomal DNA located 3' of the target
area and hIL10 (PCR2), and that PCR using primer pair 3 shows the
presence of thyA (PCR3). Stages include (1) introduction of the
nonreplicative vector; (2) 5' crossover, forced by erythromycin selection
and identified by PCR1; (3) second crossover in the absence of Em, identified
through screening by PCR2; and (4) acquisition of desired transgenic chromosome
organization. (b) PCR identification of Thy1116 by three rounds

Expression of hIL10Thy1116 contain different promoter regions. Thy15 contains
the P1 promoter15 from hIL10. Thy12 contains the
thyA promoter (PthyA). Thy 11 and Thy16 contain regions of both
promoters; Thy11 includes the thyA ATG start codon and Thy16 does not
(Fig. 2a). In all strains hIL10 replaces
thyA exactly down to its stop codon, which was expected to prevent polar
effects on downstream genes. The hIL10 gene is
syntheticcodon-optimized for L. lactis (see ref.
16) and fused to the usp45 secretion
leader17. As replacing proline with alanine at the N terminus of
a heterologous protein has been shown to increase secretion18, we
constructed a P2A mutant hIL-10, which indeed displayed markedly greater
secretion (Fig. 2b). N-terminal protein sequencing of the
secreted protein indicated that it was correctly processed, and an hIL-10
bioassay19 showed that the recombinant protein had full
biological activity. Thus, Thy11Thy16 had acquired the capacity to
produce functional hIL-10 (Fig. 2c,d; analysis done as in
ref. 2).In vivo production of hIL-10We tested in vivo production of hIL-10 using strain Thy12,
which contained the least amount of foreign DNA and showed the highest hIL-10
expression in vitro (14 ng/ml, Fig. 2c). After

Thy12 bacteria were injected into an ileal loop of a pig and incubated for 4 h,
the loop of the pig's intestine contained 4.44

colony-forming units (cfu)/ml
1.98
108 cfu/ml
(mean
standard deviation (s.d.)) Thy12 and 470.62 pg/ml (
13.98 pg/ml) hIL-10. The intestinal tissue of the loop contained 4.17
108 cfu/ml ( 1.84
108 cfu/ml)
Thy12 and 58.27 pg/ml ( 1.42 pg/ml) hIL-10. Thus, the Thy12 strain
produced hIL-10 in vivo in pigs and was able to acquire the necessary
nutrients from the pig host.In vitro viability of thyA-deficient
strainsThe survival of thyA-deficient strains depends on the
presence of thymidine or thymine in the growth medium. To assess Thy12 growth
under thymidine limitation, we inoculated 15 single, purified Thy12 colonies in
rich thymidine-free medium containing 0.5% (wt/vol) glucose. The suspension was
divided in three, and 0 M, 0.4 M (low concentration) and 10 M (high
concentration) thymidine were added, respectively. In the absence of thymidine
(Fig. 3a), the cfu of Thy12 decreased over 6 orders of
magnitude in 60 h. Beyond 72 h of incubation, no viable cells could be
detected. At low thymidine concentration (Fig. 3b), a
slight increase in cfu was immediately followed by a rapid decrease, similar to
that seen in the absence of thymidine. The high concentration of thymidine
(Fig. 3c) supported growth of the culture until
saturation, which was immediately followed by a steep decrease in viable
bacteria. No viable bacteria could be detected in cultures initiated with low
or high concentrations of thymidine after 175 and 250 h, respectively. This
decrease was not associated with substantial lysis of bacterial cells, as the
culture turbidity remained unchanged. The thymidine dependence of Thy11, Thy15
and Thy16 was identical to that of Thy12.

Thymidine auxotrophs are self-limiting because depletion of the
essential component immediately induces cell death. Thymidine auxotrophy is
thus different in nature from any auxotrophy that does not affect DNA
metabolism. For example, growth of L. lactis MG1363 is dependent on the
addition of glucose. In contrast to other bacteria, L. lactis manages
glucose starvation stressmuch as it does stress caused by such varied
agents as heat, ethanol, osmotic pressure and CdCl2by
induction of the central stress response and survival factor YtgH20. To assess the glucose stress response of strain MG1363, we
inoculated 15 individual colonies in glucose-free rich growth medium. The
suspension was split and 0%, 0.1% (low concentration) or 0.5% (high
concentration, wt/vol%) glucose was added, respectively (Fig.
3). In contrast to the results of thymidine limitation described above,
in the absence of glucose, no change in MG1363 cfu was detected until after 72
h (whereas in the absence of thymidine, all 3.2
106
Thy12 had died by that time point) (Fig. 3a). Addition of
low or high concentrations of glucose to MG1363 led to increased cfu and
stagnation over the course of 28 h, followed by a slow decrease in cfu (Fig. 3b,c). The low-glucose culture did not reach the same
plateau as the high-glucose culture, demonstrating glucose depletion (Fig.
3b). This is in marked contrast with the viability profiles of Thy12
under thymidine limitation, which showed a rapid decrease in cfu. The cfu of
strain MG1363 under glucose limitation never decreased by more than 4 orders of
magnitude from the highest level reached during growth, markedly different from
the decrease of 9 orders of magnitude seen for Thy12 at thymidine
concentrations as high as 10 M (Fig. 3c).In vivo viability of strain Thy12Even in low-thymidine conditions, Thy12 showed a substantial
reduction in viability after in vivo passage through porcine intestine.
HPLC analysis showed 1 M thymidine in total extracts of porcine ileum.
Thymidine could also be detected, albeit at (as expected) a lower concentration
(up to 0.075 M), in ileal lavages from human patients. To protect L.
lactis from nonspecific lysis by bile in the duodenum and jejunum, we used
gelatin capsules filled with equal amounts of either lyophilized Thy12 or
MG1363 and coated with an enteric coating designed for pig ileal release.
Because pigs chew their food and would thereby destroy the coating, we created
a fistula to access the proximal duodenum. A second fistula was created to
sample the ileal content (method adapted from ref. 21). The capsules were inserted through the duodenal
fistula and time samples were taken from both the ileal content and the feces.
Lactococci were detected by capturing them from suspensions of ileal or fecal
material with anti- lactococcal IgG bound to the surface of a plastic Petri
dish. We then determined bacterial cfu by washing, overlaying the Petri dishes
with low-melting agar and incubating the agar at 30 C. Before the
administration of L. lactis, none of the pigs showed any signal in this
assay. From the pig that was given MG1363, we detected 3.64
108L. lactis in the ileal samples and 2.94
108 in the feces (ratio 0.80). From the pig that was given
Thy12, we detected 2.69
108L. lactis in the
ileum and 0.125
108 in the feces (ratio 0.04) (Fig.
3d). The viability of Thy12 therefore decreased 20-fold more
rapidly after intestinal passage than did the viability of MG1363.Acquisition of foreign thyA genesTo examine whether Thy12 can spontaneously acquire a thyA
gene from an exogenous source, we produced mixed colonies of Thy12 and
potential thyA 'donor' bacteria by superposed inoculation on solid agar
plates. In these mixed colonies, very high bacterial densities of up to 5
1011 cfu/ml were obtained. The colonies were plated on
solid agar plates containing thymidine-free medium, thereby possibly selecting
for thyA gene transfer to Thy12. Potential donor bacteria tested were
L. lactis MG1363, L. lactis subsp. lactis and subsp.
cremoris, Lactobacillus casei, Escherichia coli DH5 and
O157, and Salmonella choleraesuis. Thy12 was transformed with an
erythromycin (Em) resistance plasmid and donor strains were transformed with a
chloramphenicol (Cm) resistance marker. We were unable to isolate any
EmRL. lactis strain that showed thymidine-independent
growth. In contrast, mixed colonies on thymidine-free-medium solid agar plates
supplemented with thymidine were composed of comparable numbers of
EmR and CmR bacteria.Top of page
DiscussionHere we describe a system for the containment of live genetically
modifed bacteria intended for therapeutic use in humans. The L. lactisthyA gene was replaced with expression constructs driving a synthetic
hIL10 gene, resulting in strains that produce hIL-10 and are strictly
dependent on thymidine or thymine for growth and survival. These strains are
self-limiting because they die rapidly in the absence of their essential growth
component.Biological containment systems can be subdivided into active and
passive forms. Active containment provides control through the conditional
production of a toxic compound whose expression is tightly controlled by an
environmentally responsive element or suppressed by an immunity factor22.
Some well-integrated active systems of this type have been developed. Homologs
of the Hok plasmid maintenance factor, Gef and RelF were used for the
control of Pseudomonas putida23 and E. coli24, respectively. Other active containment systems for E. coli
include the phage T7 lysozyme25, the type II EcoRI
restriction-modification system26 and colicin E3 (ref.
27). Although active containment systems provide
actual killing of the host, they have notable drawbacks. First, these systems
often involve the introduction of a large amount of foreign DNA, which impedes
their use in humans. Second, many are plasmid borne, and it remains to be
demonstrated that function is maintained when the plasmids become integrated in
the bacterial chromosome to reduce lateral dissemination.In passive systems, which circumvent these limitations, growth is
dependent on complementation of an auxotrophy or other gene defect by
supplementation with either the intact gene or the essential metabolite. For
example, plasmids carrying a heterologous alanine racemase (alr) are
stably inherited in a alr background28, and
experiments are presently ongoing using an alr deletion mutant for
containment of a genetically modifed strain of Streptococcus mutans
designed for anti-carie therapy (J. Hillman, personal communication). The
lacF gene can be used as a selection marker in lacFL.
lactis29. An amber suppressor, supD, has been used as a
selectable marker for plasmid maintenance to complement suppressible pyrimidine
auxotrophs30. However, passive systems have the drawback that
they are often bacteriostatic rather than bactericidal.The choice of thyA as a target gene combines the advantages of
passive and active containment systems. 'Thymine-less death'31,
which was described as early as 1954 (ref. 32),
involves activation of the SOS repair system and DNA fragmentation, thereby
constituting an indigenous suicide system. Thymine and thymidine growth
dependence differs from most other auxotrophies31 in that absence
of the essential component is bactericidal in the former and bacteriostatic in
the latter. Thus, thyA-deficient bacteria cannot accumulate in the
environment. thyA from L. casei has been used as a selective
marker for plasmid maintenance in thyA-deficient Lactobacillus
acidophilus33. Researchers isolated the thyA gene of
L. lactis MG1363 (ref. 11) but were unable
to isolate thyA-deficient strains by use of conventional selection
methods (P. Ross, personal communication). Such a strain was recently generated
by targeted gene deletion34.Thy12 provides a satisfactory solution to concerns about biosafety for
several reasons. First, only the absolute minimal amount of foreign
DNAthe gene of interestis present in the genetically modified
organism. No resistance marker is required to guarantee stable inheritance of
the transgene. Second, accumulation of the genetically modified organism in the
environment is very unlikely, as rapid death occurs upon thymidine starvation.
We observed a 107-fold decrease in cfu after 72 h in the absence
of thymidine. Even after prolonged incubation in rich growth medium devoid of
thymidine, we failed to isolate revertants or suppressors. In addition, we did
not observe acquisition of thyA from other microorganisms. Owing to high
sequence diversity at thyA loci, successful acquisition would probably
be possible only from the homologous L. lactis subsp. Cremoris
cremoris. Third, were the intact thyA acquired by homologous
recombination, the transgene would be removed. Fourth, the risk of
disseminating the genetic modification through lateral gene transfer is
minimized because the hIL10 gene is integrated in the L. lactis
chromosome. Several mechanisms for lateral gene transfer do not function in
Thy1116: L. lactis MG1363 is deficient for Tn916 and Tn919
conjugative transposition35 and phage replication is severely
impaired in thyA-deficient L. lactis, thereby disabling
phage-mediated transduction of host genetic material34.Our approach thus provides a simple and robust system for biological
containment. One of the strains reported here, Thy12, has been approved by the
Dutch authorities as an experimental therapy for humans with IBD. This clinical
trial will be the first to use a live genetically modified bacterial
therapeutic.Top of page
MethodsThymidine-free medium.Thymidine-free medium was obtained by growing L. lactis Thy12 to
saturation in M17 broth (Difco) containing 0.5% (wt/vol) glucose. Bacteria were
then removed by centrifugation, filtration and sterilization.Genetically modified strains of L. lactis
MG1363.Strains were constructed as described in the Results section and as
shown in Figure 1. Further details are available upon
request.Animal experiments.Eight-week-old Pitrain/Landrace crossbred pigs were fasted
overnight and anesthetized with zoletil 100 (Virbac, France) (2% (wt/vol)
xylazine; 0.22 ml per kg body weight) administered intramuscularly (i.m.)).Ileal loop incubations were performed as described36.
Care was taken to minimize surgical trauma and to maintain an adequate blood
supply to the ligated segments. Lyophilized Thy12 culture (3.0751 g, 1.44
1011
1.72
1010) was
resuspended in 11.3 ml M9 buffer2 without nutrients, thymidine or
thymine, and 5 ml was injected with a 26-G needle into an ileal loop of 5
cm length. The volume of loop contents before injection could not be
determined. The small intestine was returned to the abdominal cavity and the
abdomen was closed. During the 4-h incubation period, the pig was conscious and
received finadyne as analgesic (1 ml per 45 kg body weight, i.m.).The sample was left to incubate in the conscious pig for 4 h. The
contents of the loop were isolated with a syringe and the tissue was washed and
homogenized.Duodenal and ileal fistulae were created as described21. After laparotomy, a duodenal fistula and an ileal fistula were
created. After a 10-d recovery, the capsules were inserted in the duodenal
fistula. Euthanasia was performed by intravenous injection of pentobarbital (24
mg per kg body weight). All animal experimentation was carried out in
accordance with Belgian law (KB 14/11/1993; approval was obtained from the
ethical committee of the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Ghent University, file
no. EC 2002/06).Counting of L. lactis in ileal and fecal
material.Ileal or fecal material was resuspended in M9N (M9, as in ref.
2, containing 0.05% (wt/vol) NaN3; at 4
C, this solution did not affect lactococcal viability over a period of 2
weeks) at a ratio of 1 g per 9 ml. Large particles were removed by filtering
through a 80-m cell strainer (Becton Dickinson). All particulate material
was collected from the suspension by centrifugation, resuspended in 1:10 vol of
M9N and further diluted, as appropriate, in M9N. Bacterial Petri dishes (Bibby
Sterilin) were coated with 3 ml of 10 g/ml rabbit anti-MG1363 IgG in M9N
and incubated overnight at 4 C. The non bound antiserum was removed and
the plates were blocked overnight at 4 C with 10 ml 0.1% (wt/vol) casein
in M9N. The blocking solution was removed and the plates were overlaid with 3
ml of the suspensions of fecal or ileal material and incubated for 3 h at 22
C. Plates were washed three times with water, overlaid with M17 containing
0.5% (wt/vol) glucose, 50 g/ml thymidine and 0.8% (wt/vol) agar, incubated
for 24 h at 30 C and counted.Accession number.The GenBank accession number for the thyA locus is
