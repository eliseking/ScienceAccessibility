This process may be called either Genetic Engineering (GE) or Genetic Modification (GM); they are one and the same.\nBut havent growers been grafting trees, breeding animals, and hybridizing seeds for years?\nGenetic engineering is completely different from traditional breeding and carries unique risks.\nIn traditional breeding it is possible to mate a pig with another pig to get a new variety, but is not possible to mate a pig with a potato or a mouse. Even when species that may seem to be closely related do succeed in breeding, the offspring are usually infertile. A horse, for example, can mate with a donkey, but the offspring (a mule) is sterile.\nWith genetic engineering, scientists can breach species barriers set up by nature. For example, they have spliced fish genes into tomatoes. The results are plants (or animals) with traits that would be virtually impossible to obtain with natural processes, such as crossbreeding or grafting.\nHow is genetic engineering done?\nBecause living organisms have natural barriers to protect themselves against the introduction of DNA from a different species, genetic engineers have to find ways to force the DNA from one organism into another. These methods include:\nUsing viruses or bacteria to infect animal or plant cells with the new DNA.\nCoating DNA onto tiny metal pellets, and firing it with a special gun into the cells.\nInjecting the new DNA into fertilized eggs with a very fine needle.\nUsing electric shocks to create holes in the membrane covering sperm, and then forcing the new DNA into the sperm through these holes.\nIs genetic engineering precise?\nThe technology of genetic engineering is currently very crude. It is not possible to insert a new gene with any accuracy, and the transfer of new genes can disrupt the finely controlled network of DNA in an organism.\nCurrent understanding of the way in which DNA works is extremely limited, and any change to the DNA of an organism at any point can have side effects that are impossible to predict or control. The new gene could, for example, alter chemical reactions within the cell or disturb cell functions. This could lead to instability, the creation of new toxins or allergens, and changes in nutritional value.\nDoes the biotech industry hold any promise?\nGenetic modification of plants is not the only biotechnology. The study of DNA does hold promise for many potential applications, including medicine. However, the current technology of GM foods is based on obsolete information and theory, and is prone to dangerous side effects. Economic interests have pushed it onto the market too soon.\nMoreover, molecular marker technologiesso called Marker Assisted Selection (MAS) used with conventional breeding shows much promise for developing improved crop varieties, without the potentially dangerous side effects of direct genetic modification.\nGMOs in Foods:\nWhat kinds of traits have been added to food crops?\nAlthough there are attempts to increase nutritional benefits or productivity, the two main traits that have been added to date are herbicide tolerance and the ability of the plant to produce its own pesticide. These results have no health benefit, only economic benefit.\nHerbicide tolerance lets the farmer spray weed-killer directly on the crop without killing it.\nCrops such as Bt cotton produce pesticides inside the plant. This kills or deters insects, saving the farmer from having to spray pesticides. The plants themselves are toxic, and not just to insects. Farmers in India, who let their sheep graze on Bt cotton plants after the harvest, saw thousands of sheep die!\nWhy do genetically engineered foods have antibiotic resistant genes in them?\nThe techniques used to transfer genes have a very low success rate, so the genetic engineers attach marker genes that are resistant to antibiotics to help them to find out which cells have taken up the new DNA. These marker genes are resistant to antibiotics that are commonly used in human and veterinary medicine. Some scientists believe that eating GE food containing these marker genes could encourage gut bacteria to develop antibiotic resistance.\nWhat are the problems created through genetic engineering of food and crops?\nGenetic engineers continually encounter unintended side effects. GM plants create toxins, react to weather differently, contain too much or too little nutrients, become diseased or malfunction and die. When foreign genes are inserted, dormant genes may be activated or the functioning of genes altered, creating new or unknown proteins, or increasing or decreasing the output of existing proteins inside the plant. The effects of consuming these new combinations of proteins are unknown.\nWhat foods are GM?\nIn the U.S., three major commodity crops are raised predominantly from GMO seed: field corn (92%*), soybeans (94%*), and cotton (94%*). *percentages are based on U.S. acreage as of 2015 (USDA)\nAlmost 98% of Canadian grown Canola is genetically engineered for herbicide resistance. U.S. sugar beet production is estimated to be over 95% genetically modified for herbicide resistance. GMO sweet corn, papaya, zucchini, and yellow summer squash are also for sale in grocery stores, but in far lesser amounts. Genetically modified alfalfa is grown for use as hay and forage for animals.\nNEW: White Russet brand potatoes, genetically modified to resist bruising were introduced to some grocery stores in 2015, but are not yet widely available. Genetically engineered non-browning Arctic apples have been deregulated by the USDA and are expected to be on the market in 2016.\nWhat are other sources of GMOs?\nProducts derived from the above, including oils from all four, soy protein, soy lecithin, cornstarch, corn syrup and high fructose corn syrup among others. Also:\nmeat, eggs, and dairy products from animals that have eaten GM feed (and the majority of the GM corn and soy is used for feed);\ndairy products from cows injected with rbGH (a GM hormone);\nfood additives, enzymes, flavorings, and processing agents, including the sweetener aspartame (NutraSweet) and rennet used to make hard cheeses; and\nhoney and bee pollen that may have GM sources of pollen.\nThe Health Dangers:\nWhat are the potential dangers of eating GM foods?\nThere are a number of dangers that broadly fall into the categories of potential toxins, allergens, carcinogens, new diseases, antibiotic resistant diseases, and nutritional problems.\nViewall 65 health risks of GM foods, excerpted from Jeffrey Smiths comprehensive book Genetic Roulette: The Documented Health Risks of Genetically Engineered Foods.\nHasnt research shown GM foods to be safe?\nNo. The only feeding study done with humans showed that GMOs survived inside the stomach of the people eating GMO food. No follow-up studies were done.\nVarious feeding studies in animals have resulted in potentially pre-cancerous cell growth, damaged immune systems, smaller brains, livers, and testicles, partial atrophy or increased density of the liver, odd shaped cell nuclei and other unexplained anomalies, false pregnancies and higher death rates.\nBut arent the plants chemically the same, whether or not they are GM?\nMost tests cant determine the differences at the level of the DNA. And, even if they appear to be the same, eyewitness reports from all over North American describe how several types of animals, including cows, pigs, geese, elk, deer, squirrels, and rats, when given a choice, avoid eating GM foods.\nHavent people been eating GM foods without any ill effect?\nThe biotech industry says that millions have been eating GM foods without ill effect. This is misleading. No one monitors human health impacts of GM foods. If the foods were creating health problems in the US population, it might take years or decades before we identified the cause.\nWhat indications are there that GM foods are causing problems?\nSoon after GM soy was introduced to the UK, soy allergies skyrocketed by 50 percent.\nIn March 2001, the Center for Disease Control reported that food is responsible for twice the number of illnesses in the U.S. compared to estimates just seven years earlier. This increase roughly corresponds to the period when Americans have been eating GM food.\nWithout follow-up tests, which neither the industry or government are doing, we cant be absolutely sure if genetic engineering was the cause.\nWhat about GM hormones in milk?\nMilk from rBGH-treated cows contains an increased amount of the hormone IGF-1, which is one of the highest risk factors associated with breast and prostate cancer, but no one is tracking this in relation to cancer rates.\nWhy do genetically engineered foods have antibiotic resistant genes in them?\nThe techniques used to transfer genes have a very low success rate, so the genetic engineers attach marker genes that are resistant to antibiotics to help them to find out which cells have taken up the new DNA. That way scientist can then douse the experimental GMO in antibiotics and if it lives, they have successful altered the genes. The marker genes are resistant to antibiotics that are commonly used in human and veterinary medicine. Some scientists believe that eating GE food containing these marker genes could encourage gut bacteria to develop antibiotic resistance.\nBut is there any documented instance of adverse effects of GMOs on people?\nOne epidemic was rare, serious, and fast acting, and therefore more easily discovered. Called EMS, it was traced to a GM brand of the food supplement L-tryptophan. In the 1980s, the contaminated brand killed about 100 Americans and caused sickness or disability in about 5,000-10,000 others.\nWhy are children particularly susceptible to the effects of GM foods?\nChildren face the greatest risk from the potential dangers of GM foods for the same reasons that they also face the greatest risk from other hazards like pesticides and radiation, these include:\nYoung, fast-developing bodies are influenced most.\nChildren are more susceptible to allergies.\nChildren are more susceptible to problems with milk.\nChildren are more susceptible to nutritional problems.\nChildren are in danger from antibiotic resistant diseases.\nHow dangerous, or potentially dangerous, are GM foods relative to other food dangers, e.g., pesticides, irradiation, additives, preservatives?\nSince so little research has been done on the safety of GM foods, it is not possible to rank its risks. Unlike the others, GM crops persist in the environment, and may continue to pose risks to health for centuries.\nIn addition, transfer of transgenes to gut bacteria may present long-term chronic exposure, since the foreign protein may continued to be produced inside of us after we no longer consume the GM food.\nDangers to the environment and traditional agriculture:\nWhat is the effect of growing GM crops on the environment?\nStudies have shown that pesticide-producing crops contaminate nearby streams, possibly affecting aquatic life. They may harm beneficial insects too.\nAs weeds adapt to herbicides, they develop resistance and evolve into what are called super weeds.When that happens, herbicide use increases and the benefits of herbicide resistant crops are diminished, if not lost.\nCan the growing of GM crops effect nearby crops?\nPollen from GM crops can contaminate nearby crops of the same type, except for soy, which does not cross-pollinate. Canola and cotton also cross-pollinate.\nWhy is there an effort to create GM-free agricultural zones?\nUsing identity preservation (IP), farmers keep crop varieties separate from others to meet purity requirements of their buyers. Contamination is a key challenge to IP growers. Unwanted varieties may cross-pollinate or get mixed up in the seed, harvest equipment, or during storage and transport.\nSome farm regions create entire zones that exclude unwanted varieties, where all the farms, and if possible all collection and distribution points, only handle approved grain.\nHave any local efforts in the US been successful?\nThere are local efforts throughout the U.S. that are raising public awareness, changing laws, and creating commitments to non-GM ingredients. Most notably, voters in Mendocino and Marin Counties in California passed a ballot initiative to ban GM crops.\nOfficials in Trinity County and Arcata, California have passed ordinances banning the outdoor cultivation of GM crops as well. But since then, a California law was passed prohibiting this type of local initiative.\nIn March 2008, voters at the Montville, Maine, annual town meeting overwhelmingly passed a binding ordinance banning the cultivation of GM crops in their community.\nIs it possible that organically grown crops can be infected by GM genes?\nYes. Organic standards do not allow the use of GM seeds and therefore steps are taken to try to prevent contamination. Tests are not required, although some vigilant organic companies require them. According to the organic standards, contamination by cross-pollination is not disallowed, but some companies reject contaminated product above some small amount such as 0.1%.\nOrganic canola farmers in Canada sued biotech companies, since cross-pollination has made it impossible for them to grow organic, non-GM canola.\nIs the Natural Foods Industry doing something to ensure the purity of its products?\nRight now there are efforts underway for an industry wide clean up of foods labeled organic and non-GMO. A handful of noble companies took it upon themselves to ensure that consumers could rest assured that their organic and non-GMO foods are truly free of modified genes. They established The Non-GMO Project, which has created an industry-wide consensus-based set of standards and a third-party verification process with testing for GMO content.\nCompanies began to enroll their products in the spring of 2008; over 33,000 individual products have been verified to date (Oct-2015).\nGovernment Regulation:\nHasnt the FDA said that GM foods are safe?\nThe biotech industry claims that the FDA has thoroughly evaluated GM foods and found them safe. This is untrue. The FDA does not require safety studies. Instead, if the makers of the GM foods claim that they are safe, the agency has no further questions.\nDidnt the scientists at the FDA study GM foods themselves?\nNo. The FDA relies solely on information supplied by the biotech companies.\nWhat kind of information did the companies provide?\nCalgene, the makers of the first GM crop, the FlavrSavr tomato, was the only company to submit detailed raw data from animal feeding studies to the FDA. The rest provide only summaries and conclusions. Industry research can be rigged; data often is omitted or distorted.\nIn the FlavrSavr tests, lab rats refused to eat the tomatoes and had to be force-fed. Several developed stomach lesions, and seven of forty died within two weeks. Still, the tomato was approved, but has since been taken off the market.\nBased on the information that was supplied, did the FDA scientist have concerns?\nAgency scientists did warn that GM foods might create toxins, allergies, nutritional problems, and new diseases that might be difficult to identify. Internal FDA memos reveal that the scientists urged their superiors to require long-term safety testing to catch these hard-to-detect side effects.\nWhat did the FDA do about these concerns?\nNothing was done that would protect consumers. In fact, in the case of genetically modified bovine growth hormone, some FDA scientists who expressed concerns were harassed, stripped of responsibilities, or fired. The remaining whistleblowers had to write an anonymous letter to Congress complaining of fraud and conflict of interest at the agency\nHow could the government approve dangerous foods?\nA close examination reveals that industry manipulation and political collusion  not sound science  was the driving force.\nThe FDA official in charge ignored all warnings of the FDA staff scientists. The official, a former outside attorney for Monsanto, was a political appointee specifically to a new FDA post on GM policy, and left shortly after to become vice president at Monsanto.\nWhy arent foods with GMOs at least labeled here?\nThe same political influence and money that got them past the FDA has prevented any labeling laws from being passed. However, President Obama had indicated support for labeling laws during his campaign.\nAround the World\nWhat about in neighboring countries?\nIn Canada, government scientists also complained that they were being pressured to approve the GM hormone, which is injected into cows to increase milk supply. They were concerned about human health impacts. They testified that the drugs maker, Monsanto, offered them a bribe of $1-2 million to approve it. They also reported that documents were stolen from a locked file cabinet in a government office.\nMexico has resisted GMOs, but contamination has still occurred.\nOther stories of pressure, bribes, and threatened whistleblowers are reported through the history of GM foods and their approval, research, and promotion around the world.\nWhat is happening with GM foods in the rest of the world?\nAll over the world, regions and even nations are demanding an end to GM crop cultivation. Twenty-two countries in Europe have regions wanting to be GM-free. States in Australia, regions in New Zealand and Brazil, the countries of Venezuela, Zambia, Sudan, Angola, and others, all want to be GM-free. Thus, world markets are shrinking.\nIn 2009, Germany joined France, Hungary, Italy, Greece, Austria, Poland and Romania in banning Monsantos Mon 810 GM corn because of its documented hazards to biodiversity and human health. In 2007 over three million Italians signed a petition, declaring their opposition to GM crops in their country. In Europe over 175 regions and over 4,500 municipalities have declared themselves GM-free zones. In Spain alone this includes over 50 municipalities and regions like Asturias, the Canary Islands and the Basque country.\nEurope has greater rejection of GMOs due to a more balanced reporting by their press on the health and environmental dangers. In Europe, at least 174 regions, more than 4,500 councils and local governments have declared themselves GM free.\nHave any GM foods been banned?\nThe rules of the World Trade Organization (which the US and other 150 countries are members of) explicitly prohibit countries from banning GM products. Therefore, countries that ban them do so at great risk. If this werent the case, no doubt many countries would already have done so.\nSome countries have banned GM crops entirely or not approved certain GM crops that are approved elsewhere.\nIn the US, GM wheat was not approved when wheat farmers banded together because they were concerned that contamination would seriously hurt exports. So the reason was economic, not safety.\nSearch for:\nSign up for Spilling the Beans, IRT's NewsletterFirst Name * Last Name * Email * Zip/Postal Code * Join a group:Newsletter* RequiredSupport our Mission to Educate Consumers and Rid GMOs from Our Food Supply!
