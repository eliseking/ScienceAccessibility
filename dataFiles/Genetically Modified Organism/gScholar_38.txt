SynonymsGEO; GMO; Genetically engineered organismsDefinitionGenetically modified organisms (GMOs) are organisms which have had their genetic codes altered through direct manipulation of the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). This is present in all cells and is the means whereby characteristics are passed down from one generation to another.DescriptionThe first genetically modified organism was produced in 1973; this was a recombinant form of the bacterium Escherichia coli which was altered to incorporate a gene from the bacterium Salmonella. The incorporated gene is known as an exogene which signifies that it originates from another organism. It is also possible to manipulate in situ genes so that a particular characteristic is amplified, for example, drought resistance in crops. This technology is one aspect of biotechnology which involves the control or harnessing of organisms for human benefit. It contrasts with long-established plant and animal breeding progr ...
