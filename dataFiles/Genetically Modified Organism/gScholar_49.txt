Abstract. An event-specific PCR method for detection and quantification of genetically modified Roundup Ready soybean (RRS) is described in this article. The complete DNA sequence at both the right and left integration sites of this genetically modified organism has recently been determined. Based on these sequence data, transformation event-specific primer pairs were developed. These primers amplify a fragment of the unique junction region between the inserted DNA and the plant DNA and therefore act as unique identifiers. Two sensitive, qualitative PCR assays gave absolute detection limits of 5 copies of the RRS junction fragment in 100pg of total DNA per reaction. A real-time PCR method was then developed with the LightCycler System. For determination of the RRS content, a completely new type of external calibration standard is introduced here. A fragment of the RRS specific junction region and a fragment of the endogenous soybean lectin gene were both cloned in a plasmid vector. These new diagnostic DNA fragments allow quantification of RRS in whichever type of matrix, in a range of 10106 copies of each target.Cloned DNA standard Quantitative real-time PCR Event-specific primer pair Roundup Ready soybean Food analysisRevised version: 10 July 2001Electronic PublicationDownload to read the full article textCopyright informationSpringer-Verlag2001Authors and AffiliationsIsabelTaverniers1PieterWindels1ErikVan Bockstaele1MarcDe Loose11.Department for Plant Genetics and Breeding, Centre for Agricultural Research, Caritasstraat 21, 9090 Melle, Belgium
