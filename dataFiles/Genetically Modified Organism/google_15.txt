Genetic engineering is used to alter the genetic material of living things to create combinations that do not occur in nature.\nContinue Reading\nKeep Learning\nWhat is genetic manipulation?\nHow are plasmids used in genetic engineering?\nWhat is gene splicing?\nFull Answer\nGMOs have a wide range of applications, and are especially prevalent in food production, pharmaceutical drugs and experimental medicine. Genetic engineering differs from selective breeding in that the organism's genes are directly added, removed or manipulated in a laboratory setting. This is done by physically inserting DNA into the nucleus of a host with a very small syringe, with the use of gene guns or electric pulses, or by introducing the new genes to the host by way of a virus.\nIn agriculture, crops have been genetically engineered to give them enhanced resistance to pests and herbicides. They are also sometimes given added nutritional value, as in the case of golden rice, which is modified to contain high levels of beta-carotene. Genetically engineered micro-organisms are also sometimes used as enzymes for the production of processed foods, including cheese and fruit juice.\nIn medicine, genetically modified bacteria produce insulin for diabetic patients. Genetically modified animals are also used in medical research, and gene therapy employs genetically modified viruses in an attempt to cure genetic disorders.\nLearn more about Molecular Biology & DNA\nSources:\nnongmoproject.org\nen.wikipedia.org\nRelated Questions\nQ:\nWhat is a list of some of the disadvantages of genetic engineering?\nA:\nSome of the disadvantages of genetic engineering are health risks, environmental impacts, impacts on agriculture and industry, and ethical issues that may ...\nFull Answer >\nFiled Under:\nMolecular Biology & DNA\nQ:\nWhat is GMO food?\nA:\nGMOs, or genetically modified organisms, are organisms that have undergone some changes to their DNA through genetic engineering.
