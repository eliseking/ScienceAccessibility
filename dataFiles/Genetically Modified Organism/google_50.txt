Genetically Modified Organisms
Objectives
Using actual cases, provide background on the development and use of genetically modified organisms.
Introduce the ethical issues that have emerged from these cases.
Offer students the opportunity to identify and articulate an ethical position related to issues in each case study.
Curriculum Integration Ideas
These case studies may be used in life or social science classes where there are units for topics including:
Environmental Science
Health and Nutrition
Genetics
Plant Biology, Botany, Microbiology
Background
Genetic engineering technology has given scientists the power to do amazing things. Scientists are now able to create entirely new varieties of microorganisms, plants, and animals. By changing or augmenting the genome of an organism, using a variety of methods, scientists have figured out ways to make plants disease-resistant, special animals for experimentation, crops more productive, and food tastier. But all of these advances have corresponding ethical, legal, social, and ecological risks. This high school bioethics brief offers you a set of case studies to examine while you reflect on the ethical issues emerging from advances in genetically modified organisms.
