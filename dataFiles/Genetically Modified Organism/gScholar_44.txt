Surface plasmon resonance biosensor for genetically modified organisms detectionElisa Mariotti, Maria Minunni, , Marco Mascini Universit degli Studi di Firenze, Dipartimento di Chimica, Via G. Capponi 9, 50121 Firenze, ItalyReceived 28 June 2001, Revised 11 October 2001, Accepted 11 October 2001, Available online 6 November 2001AbstractThe development of a surface plasmon resonance (SPR) affinity biosensor based on DNA hybridisation is described. This biosensor has been applied to genetically modified organisms (GMOs) detection. Single stranded DNA (ssDNA) probes were immobilised on the sensor chip of an SPR device and the hybridisation between the immobilised probe and the complementary sequence (target) was monitored. The probe sequences were internal to the sequence of 35S promoter and NOS terminator which are inserted sequences in the genome of GMO regulating the transgene expression. The system has been optimised using synthetic oligonucleotides, then applied to real samples analysis. Samples, containing the transgenic target sequences, were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and then detected with the SPR biosensor.KeywordsSurface plasmon resonance; Biosensor; Polymerase chain reaction1. Introduction1.1. GMOs characterisationGMOs are referred to as living organisms whom genome has been modified by the introduction of an exogenous gene able to express an additional protein that confers new characteristics.The foreign DNA is usually inserted in a gene cassette consisting of an expression promoter (P), a structural gene (encoding region) and an expression terminator (T) (Fig. 1). Alternatively physical methods (e.g. particle gun) or chemical methods (e.g. polyethylene glycol or electroporation) may be used [1]. The promoter of the subunit 35S of ribosomal RNA of cauliflower mosaic virus (P35S) and the terminator NOS from Agrobacterium tumefaciens are widely used for the production of many transgenic vegetables, as soy Roundup Ready, maize MaisGard and the tomato Flavr Savr.Fig. 1.(a) Schematic representation of a gene cassette, consisting of a promoter (P), a structural gene (coding region) and a terminator (T); (b) two cassettes integrated into the host genome.Figure optionsDownload full-size imageDownload as PowerPoint slideAt present, many GMOs, included many vegetables, have already been set up. Some genetically engineered plants are waiting for authorisation, whereas others have already been approved by several countries: US, Canada, European Union, Switzerland, Australia, Argentina, Brazil and Japan.Concerning GM plants, new proteins usually confer herbicide tolerance [2], fertility/maturation modification or virus, fungi, parasite, drug or insect resistance [3]. Many countries have developed laws controlling the marketing of GMOs. In the EU the directive 90/220 regulates the approval and the release of GMOs. Labelling of the genetically modified organism is not mandatory in US, but in Europe the novel food regulation will require the labelling of GM products [4]. At present, in EU, labelling is mandatory for foodstuff containing ingredients derived from genetically modified maize (the Bt-Maize from Novartis) and soybean (RR-soy from Monsanto) in percentage higher than 1% [5].There are some analytical methods already available for GMOs detection, based on two approaches: based on detection of exogenous DNA and proteins, respectively. One method for the detection of transgenic material at DNA level has been already validated by a collaborative study conducted among different laboratories and it refers to the detection of 35S promoter and NOS terminator in flour samples [6]. This method associates the amplification by PCR with gel electrophoresis, which does not give any sequence information and employs toxic reagents. More recently quantitative methods for transgenic DNA detection are under study; some results have been reported [7]and[8] using the real-time PCR approach.In this paper we describe a simple, sensitive and selective screening method for the detection of GMOs that associates the amplification of DNA by PCR with a surface plasmon resonance (SPR) affinity biosensor commercially available, the Biacore X. The system relays on DNA sensing based on the hybridisation of a DNA probe immobilised on the sensor surface and the complementary oligonucleotides (target) in solution. The immobilised probes are specific for 35S promoter and NOS terminator sequences, characteristic of GMOs.In literature are already reported some works for DNA hybridisation studies with SPR transduction, using the Biacore X but all of them use a different expedients to allow hybridisation on the sensor surface with the immobilised probe [9], [10]and[11]. SPR imaging has been employed to detect ssDNA [12] and ssRNA, but the main point still remains the detection of PCR amplified samples which are double stranded DNA. We point out that the most common procedure adopted for dissociating the double DNA strand in hybridisation studies, the thermal denaturation, is not suitable using Biacore X, while it is useful for other DNA-based sensors, i.e. electrochemical, piezoelectric [13], [14], [15], [16]and[17]. The procedure presented in this case is based on the dissociation at high pH and physical separation of the two strands by the use of magnetic particles coated with immobilised streptavidin.2. Experimental2.1. Apparatus, reagents and samplesFor all the experiments the SPR device Biacore X and the sensor chip (sensor surface Au) from Biacore AB Uppsala, Sweden were used.11-Mercaptoundecanol was synthesised in our laboratory from the corresponding -hydroxyalkylbromide. Streptavidin Magnesphere paramagnetic particles (SA-PMP) were purchased from Promega (Madison, WI, USA), dextran from Pharmacia Biotech (Uppsala, Sweden), epichlorohydrin and N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) from Fluka (Milan, Italy). Ethanol and all the reagents for the buffers were purchased from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). The composition of the buffers used for the experiments is reported below:Immobilisation buffer: NaCl 300mM, Na2HPO4 20mM, EDTA 0.1mM, pH 7.4.Hybridisation buffer: NaCl 150mM, Na2HPO4 20mM, EDTA 0.1mM, pH 7.4.Binding buffer: TrisHCl 10mM (pH 7.5), EDTA 1mM, NaCl 2M, 2-mercaptoethanol 1mM, Tween 20 0.1%.
All other reagents were purchased from Sigma Aldrich (Milan, Italy). Oligonucleotides and PCR functionalised primers were purchased from Pharmacia Biotech (Uppsala, Sweden).The base sequences of the 5-biotinylated probes (25-mer), of the fully complementary oligonucleotides (25-mer) and of the non-complementary oligonucleotide (23-mer) are as below:Probe (35S)5-GGCCATCGTTGAAGATGCCTCTGCC-3Probe (T-NOS)5-AATGATTAATTGCGGGACTCTAATC-3Target (35S)5-GGCAGAGGCATCTTCAACGATGGCC-3Target (T-NOS)5-GATTAGAGTCCCGCAATTAATCATT-3Non-complementary strand5-TGCCCACACCGACGGCGCCCACC-3Full-size tableTable optionsView in workspaceDownload as CSVPost PCR analysis by gel electrophoresis was used to confirm presence of target sequence (Fig. 2). Samples obtained from commercially available certified reference material (CRM) from soybean powder (2% Roundup Ready, Fluka, Italy) were amplified following the procedure reported by Pietsch et al. [6]. From the amplification of the two DNA regions, P35S and T-NOS, fragments of 195 and 180 base pairs (bp), respectively, were obtained. The control solution (blank) was a solution containing all the PCR reagents except the DNA template containing the target sequence.
