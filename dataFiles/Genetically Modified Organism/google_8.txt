The form of regulation varies depending on\nthe type of GMO involved.\nI. Introduction\nThe United\nStates does not have any federal legislation that is specific to genetically\nmodified organisms (GMOs). Rather, GMOs are regulated pursuant to health,\nsafety, and environmental legislation governing conventional products. The US\napproach to regulating GMOs is premised on the assumption that regulation\nshould focus on the nature of the products, rather than the process in which\nthey were produced.[1]\nCompared to\nother countries, regulation of GMOs in the US is relatively favorable to their\ndevelopment. GMOs are an economically important component of the biotechnology\nindustry, which now plays a significant role in the US economy.[2]\nFor example, the US is the worlds leading producer of genetically modified\n(GM) crops. In 2012, of the 170.3 million hectares of biotech crops globally,\nthe United States accounted for 69.5 million, over 40% of the total.[3]\nFor several crops grown in the US, genetically engineered varieties now make up\nthe vast majority of the crop. In 2013, 93% of the soybeans, 90% of the\ncotton, and 90% of the corn grown in the US were genetically engineered for\neither herbicide tolerance or insect resistance.[4]\nThe US is not a\nparty to the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety.[5]\nAs a signatory but a nonparty to the parent Convention on Biological Diversity,\nit cannot become a party to the Protocol.[6]\nIt has participated in meetings as a nonparty observer, however.[7]\nBack to Top\nII. Public and Scholarly\nOpinion\nA. Public Opinion\nPublic opinion on GMOs in the US is mixed. A series of\npolls conducted over five years, from 2001 to 2006, found that public\nunderstanding of biotechnology was relatively low, and that consumers were\nrelatively unaware of the extent to which their foods included genetically\nmodified ingredients.[8]\nSupport for the introduction of genetically modified foods into the food supply\nheld steady at 26 to 27% of respondents in favor over that time period, while\nopposition to the introduction of such foods fell from 58 to 46% over the\nperiod.[9]\nPolls indicate strong support for labeling of GMO foods;\none recent poll found 93% of respondents supporting mandatory labeling.[10] The same poll found three-fourths\nof Americans expressing concern regarding GMOs in food; nearly half indicating\nthey were aware that many processed or packaged foods contain genetically\nmodified ingredients; around half saying they would not eat genetically\nmodified vegetables, fruits, and grains; three-quarters stating they would not\neat genetically modified fish; and two-thirds saying they would not eat\ngenetically modified meat.[11]\nB. Scholarly Opinion\nSeveral\nscientific organizations in the US have issued studies or statements\nregarding the safety of GMOs indicating that there is\nno evidence that GMOs present unique safety risks compared to\nconventionally\nbred products. These include the National Research Council,[12] the American Association for the\nAdvancement of Science,[13] and the American Medical Association.[14]\nGroups in the US opposed to GMOs include some environmental\norganizations,[15] organic farming organizations,[16] and consumer organizations.[17]\nA substantial number of legal academics have criticized the USs approach to regulating GMOs.[18]\nBack to Top\nIII. Structure of\nPertinent Legislation\nThere is no\ncomprehensive federal legislation specifically addressing GMOs. GMOs are\nregulated under the general statutory authority of environmental, health, and\nsafety laws.\nA policy\nstatement published in 1986 by the Executive Office of the President, Office of\nScience and Technology Policy (OSTP) entitled the Coordinated Framework for\nRegulation of Biotechnology (Coordinated Framework)[19] sets forth the basic approach to the regulation of GMOs in the US. The\nCoordinated Framework was the outgrowth of efforts by an interagency\nworking group formed in 1984 to address whether the regulatory framework that\npertained to conventional products was adequate for products derived from\nbiotechnology. The working group concluded that existing laws as then\nimplemented, supplemented with new regulations, were adequate to address\nregulatory needs.[20]\nA proposed notice was published and comments were requested.[21] The final Coordinated Framework\npolicy notice confirmed that the regulatory jurisdiction over biotechnology\nproducts would be allocated in the same manner as conventional products, using\nexisting laws governing conventional products.[22]\nThe\nthree main agencies involved in regulating GMOs are the US Department of\nAgricultures Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), the Food and\nDrug Administration (FDA), and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).\nA. Animal and Plant Health\nInspection Service\nAPHIS\nregulates the planting, importation, or transportation of GM plants pursuant to\nits authority under the Plant Protection Act (PPA),[23] which authorizes the Secretary of\nAgriculture to prohibit or restrict the importation, entry, exportation, or\nmovement in interstate commerce of any plant, plant product [etc.] if the\nSecretary determines [it] is necessary to prevent the introduction . . . of a\nplant pest or noxious weed within the United States.[24] By regulation, APHIS classifies most\nGM plants as plant pests or potential plant pests and as regulated articles.[25] Under the PPA, a regulated article\nmust receive prior approval from APHIS before it is introduced.[26]\nAPHIS\ngrants authorization to use GM plants in three ways: through a notification\nprocess, a permitting process, or a determination of nonregulated status.\n1. Notification Procedure\nThe\nnotification procedure is available to plants that are not classified as\nnoxious weeds, or weeds in the release area, if certain criteria and\nperformance standards are met.[27] The criteria include that the plant must be a species that APHIS has\ndetermined may be safely introduced; the genetic material must be stably\nintegrated; the expression of the genetic material must not result in plant\ndisease; etc.[28]\nThe performance standards govern shipment, storage, planting, and testing, and\nare intended to prevent the plant from being released from containment.[29] When the applicant sends a\nnotification to APHIS, APHIS will respond within a prescribed time with an\nacknowledgement or a denial.[30]\nIf the notification is denied, the applicant may apply for apermit.[31]\n2. Permit Procedure\nThe\npermit procedure requires an applicant to submit information concerning, among other\nthings, the donor organism, the recipient organism, the composition of the\nregulated article; the expression of altered genetic material in the regulated\narticle and the molecular biology of the system used to produce the article;\nthe locality where the donor and recipient organisms and the regulated article\nwere developed; the purpose of the regulated article; the quantity to be\nintroduced; processes to prevent release; the intended destination, use, and\ndistribution; and the final disposition of the regulated article.[32]\nIf APHIS grants the permit, it is subject to conditions designed to ensure both\nthat the regulated article remains contained and that APHIS can maintain\nregulatory oversight.[33]\nFailure to comply with the conditions can result in withdrawal of\nthepermit.[34]\n3. Determination of Nonregulated Status\nGM plants that have been tested and have been shown not to pose\na risk may be eligible for a determination of nonregulated status.[35] A petition for determination of\nnonregulated status must include detailed biological information on the\nregulated article and the recipient organism, published and unpublished\nscientific studies, data from field tests, and other information designed to\nassist APHIS in determining whether the plant constitutes a pest.[36] Upon receipt of a petition, APHIS\npublishes a notice in the Federal Register and allows sixty days for\npublic comment.[37]\nAPHIS has 180 days to approve in whole or part or deny the petition.[38]\nB. Food and Drug Administration\nThe\nFDA regulates the safety of all human and animal food products in the US (other\nthan meat, poultry, and eggs), as well as drugs and biological products.\n1. Food\nThe\nFDAs primary statutory authority is the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act\n(FFDCA),[39] which authorizes the agency to regulate, among other things, adulterated food,[40] defined as food that contains any\npoisonous or deleterious substance that may render it deleterious to health,[41] and food additives,[42] which include any substance [that\nmay] becom[e] a component or otherwise affect[] the characteristics of any\nfood.[43]\nThe FFDCA prohibits the sale of adulterated or misbranded food.[44]\nUnder\nthe FFDCA, substances added to food can be classified either as food\nadditives, which require approval from the FDA that they are safe before they\ncan be marketed,[45] and substances added to food classified as generally recognized as safe\n(GRAS), as to which preapproval is not needed.[46]\nIn a\n1992 policy statement, the FDA reaffirmed that in most cases it would treat\nfoods derived from GMOs like those derived from conventionally bred plants, and\nthat most foods derived from GM plants would be presumptively GRAS. However,\nwith respect to a GMO product that differs significantly in structure,\nfunction, or composition from substances found currently in food, premarket\napproval of the substance as a food additive would be required.[47]\nThe\nFDA encourages developers of new plant varieties intended for food use,\nincluding GMOs, to engage in a consultation procedure with the FDA, in order\nto ensure that human food and animal feed safety issues or other regulatory\nissues (e.g. labeling) are resolved prior to commercial distribution.[48] The consultation procedure is meant\nto enable the FDA to determine if regulatory action is needed with respect to\nfood derived from the new variety such as significantly increased levels of\nplant toxicants or anti-nutrients, reduction of important nutrients, new\nallergens, or the presence in the food of an unapproved food additive.[49] Among the issues subject to\nconsultation is the food safety of new proteins in new plant varieties,\nincluding those developed through genetic engineering.[50] The FDA makes detailed information\nregarding completed consultations publicly available.[51]\n2. Animals\nThe\nFDA also asserts jurisdiction over genetically engineered animals, pursuant to\nits authority to regulate new animal drugs (NADs) under the FFDCA.[52] Under the FFDCA, NADs are deemed\ngenerally unsafe unless the FDA has approved a New Animal Drug Application\n(NADA) for the particular use of the drug.[53]\nExcept in cases in which the FDA exercises discretion to decline to require\ncompliance,[54] or where the drug is only for investigational use and thus need only conform to\nspecified exemptions,[55] the FDA requires a genetically engineered (GE) animal to be the subject of an approved\nNADA based on a demonstration that it is safe and effective for its intended\nuse.[56]\nA NADA for a GE animal must include information on the animals identification;\nchemistry; clinical purpose; labeling; components and composition;\nmanufacturing methods, facilities, and controls; safety and effectiveness;\nenvironmental impact; and other information.[57]\n3. Drugs\nThe\nFDA also has regulatory authority over drugs generally. Companies interested\nin introducing a new drug into the US market in most cases must submit a New\nDrug Application (NDA) to the FDA, which must include extensive information and\ndata on the drugs safety and effectiveness, such as the drugs chemistry,\nmanufacture, animal and in vitro studies, clinical data, and the like.[58] Drugs developed through genetic\nengineering must go through the same NDA process as other types of drugs.\n4. Biological Products\nThe\nFDA also regulates medical products classified as biological products, which\nincludes vaccines, serums, blood products, and the like, under relevant\nprovisions of the Public Health Service Act (PHSA).[59] Biological products, whether\ninvolving genetic modification or not, must be licensed by the FDA before they\ncan be introduced. The licensing procedure for biological products requires\nsubmission to the FDA of detailed information on laboratory and clinical\nstudies, manufacturing methods, and other information relevant to whether they\nare safe and effective for their intended purpose.[60]\nC. Environmental Protection Agency\nThe\nEPA regulates pesticides and microorganisms developed through genetic\nengineering.\n1. Pesticides\nThe\nEPA regulates the manufacture, sale and use of pesticides under the Federal\nInsecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA).[61] Under FIFRA, pesticides must not\ncause unreasonable adverse effects on the environment,[62] which is defined to include both\nsafety to the environment and safety in food for consumption.[63] FIFRA requires all pesticides to be\nregistered with the EPA before they can be distributed commercially.[64] Pesticides must be tested and shown\nto be safe before they can be registered.[65]\nA registration application must include information regarding testing, identity\nof the product, draft labeling, information on tolerance of residues, and other\nsafety-related information.[66]\nPursuant\nto its authority under FIFRA, the EPA regulates plants that are genetically\nmodified to produce substances intended to control pests as to both their\nenvironmental safety and their safety in food, termed plant-incorporated\nprotectants (PIPs).[67]\nThe standard registration procedures for pesticides apply to PIPs, unless they\nare made exempt by regulation.[68]\nPIPs are exempt from FIFRA registration if the PIP is used in a crop used in\nfood and its residues are exempt from regulation under the FFDCA,[69] if the PIP is an inert ingredient\nlisted as exempt by the EPA,[70] or if the PIP is from a plant that is sexually compatible with the recipient\nplant.[71]\nWith respect to those PIPs that are exempt, if the producer of the PIP obtains\ninformation regarding adverse effects from the PIP on human health or the\nenvironment, it must share it with theEPA.[72]\n2. Microorganisms\nThe\nEPA also has authority to regulate GMOs under the Toxic Substances Control Act\n(TSCA).[73]\nThe TSCA authorizes the EPA to regulate chemical substances that may present an\nunreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment.[74] Manufacturers of covered substances\nmust submit a premanufacture notification to the EPA.[75] The EPA has determined that GMO\nmicroorganisms are chemical substances subject to regulation under the TSCA.[76] The EPA has established regulations\nspecifically for microorganisms that require submission of a Microbial\nCommercial Activity Notice (MCAN) before they are used for commercial purposes.[77] The Notice must include information\ndescribing the microorganisms characteristics and genetic construction;\nbyproducts of its manufacture, use, and disposal; health and environmental\neffects data; and other information.[78]\nD. National\nEnvironmental Policy Act\nThe\nNational Environmental Policy Act (NEPA)[79] requires federal agencies in some cases to prepare Environmental Assessments\n(EAs) of federal actions, such as adopting a policy or approving a permit, to\ndetermine if they are likely to significantly impact the environment.[80] If a federal action is likely to\nhave a significant impact, the agency must prepare a more detailed evaluation\ncalled an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS).[81] Federal agency approvals of GMOs\nmay require an EA or an EIS in some circumstances.[82]\nE. State Law\nState\nlaw generally plays little role in the regulation of GMOs in the US. The federal\npreemption doctrine, which bars conflicting state regulation when Congress\nintends federal regulation to occupy a particular field, precludes many aspects\nof state regulation of GMOs.[83]\nA\nrare example in which one states law is more stringent than federal law on\nGMOs involves a bioengineered tropical aquarium fish known as the GloFish,\nwhich is unregulated at the federal level,[84] but has been banned by the California Fish and Game Commission.[85]\nSome\nmunicipal governments in the US have banned GMO crops. For example, in\nCalifornia, the counties of Marin and Mendocino have enacted ordinances\nforbidding the cultivation of GMOs.[86]\nIn Hawaii, Kauai County and Hawaii County similarly have banned the cultivation\nof most GMO crops.[87]\nBack to Top\nIV. Restrictions on Research,\nProduction, and Marketing\nThe nature of restrictions on\nGMOs with respect to research, production and marketing in the US vary with the\ndifferent regulatory regimes that cover various aspects of genetic\nmodification.\nA. Animal and Plant Health\nInspection Service\nThe introduction of GM plants\nrequires prior approval from APHIS, by means of a notification, permitting, or\na determination of nonregulated status procedure. (See Part III(A), above.)\nB. Food and Drug Administration\n1. Foods\nThe\nFDA regards most GMO foods as presumptively falling within the category of\ngenerally regarded as safe, thus not needing premarket approval, but a GMO\nproduct that differs significantly in structure, function, or composition from\nsubstances found currently in food requires premarket approval as a food\nadditive. (See Part III(B)(1), above.)\n2. Animals\nIn most cases, the FDA requires a genetically engineered animal to be\napproved by means of a New Animal Drug Application based on a demonstration\nthat it is safe and effective for its intended use. (See Part III(B)(2),\nabove.)\n3. Drugs\nFDA requires those wishing to\nintroduce a new drug into\nthe US market, whether it involves genetic modification or not, to submit a New\nDrug Application (NDA) to the FDA, with detailed information on the drugs\nsafety and effectiveness. (See Part III(B)(3), above.)\n4. Biological Products\nThe FDA requires all biological products, regardless of whether or not they are\ndeveloped by genetic modification, to be licensed by FDA before they can be\nintroduced, with detailed information on whether they are safe and effective\nfor their intended purpose. (See Part III(B)(4), above.)\nC. Environmental Protection Agency\nUnder FIFRA, the EPA requires all pesticides to be registered\nprior to commercial distribution, and the registration must include information\non their safety. The EPA also requires PIPs to comply with the pesticide\nregistration procedures, unless they meet the criteria for exemption from these\nprocedures. (See Part III(C)(1), above.)\nUnder TSCA, the EPA requires\nthose wishing to use microorganisms\nfor commercial purposes to submit a Microbial Commercial Activity Notice\n(MCAN). (See Part III(C)(2), above.)\nD. Labeling of GMOs\nThere is no law in the US\nrequiring that GMO foods or foods with GMO ingredients be labeled to so\nindicate. Proposed federal legislation, the Genetically Engineered Food\nRight-to-Know Act,[88] which would mandate labeling of any GMO food or food with a genetically\nmodified ingredient, has been introduced in the last several Congresses, but\nhas never advanced beyond the committee stage in either chamber. At the state\nlevel, a 2012 California initiative mandating labeling of GMO foods, and a\nsimilar 2013 Washington State initiative, both failed.[89]\nThe FDA has regulatory\nauthority to prevent false and misleading labeling of foods and drugs. With\nrespect to genetically engineered foods, the FDA has stated in policy documents\nthat if a GM food product is not materially different from its traditional\ncounterpart, there is no need to label or change the name of the product, but\nname changes are appropriate when a food from a GM plant is so different from\nits traditional counterpart that the usual name no longer adequately describes\nthe new food, or if there is a safety issue to which consumers should be\nalerted, such as the presence of allergens.[90]\nBack to Top\nV. Restrictions on Releasing\nOrganisms into the Environment\nBecause US regulation of GMOs\nfocuses on the nature of the products, rather than the process in which they\nwere produced, the extent to which there are restrictions on releases of GMOs\ninto the environment depends on the GMOs in question. (See the discussion of\nthe different regulatory regimes for different types of GMOs, Part III, above.)\nBack to Top\nVI. Restrictions on GMOs in\nFoodstuffs\nGMOs\nare not restricted categorically from the US food supply. As discussed above,\nthe FDA treats foods derived from GMOs like those\nderived from conventionally bred plants, and therefore most foods derived from\nGM plants are classified as presumptively generally recognized as safe.\nHowever, with respect to a GMO product that differs significantly in\nstructure, function, or composition from substances found currently in food,\npremarket approval of the product is required. (See Part III(B)(1), above.)\nBack to Top\nVII. Liability Regime\nAll of the various statutory\nschemes under which GMOs are regulated in the US provide for civil and criminal\npenalties. For example, violations of the PPA are subject to substantial civil\nor criminal penalties;[91] knowingly importing or moving any regulated article for sale or distribution in\nviolation of the PPA is punishable by a fine, imprisonment up to five years, or\nboth.[92]\nThe liability provisions of the FFDCA list several practices that can lead to\nsignificant civil or criminal penalties, including imprisonment.[93]\nViolations of FIFRA and TSCA similarly are subject to civil or criminal\npenalties.[94]\nBack to Top\nVIII. Judicial Decisions /\nProminent Cases\nA landmark case\nof significance in the early development of the US biotechnology industry was\nthe US Supreme Courts 1980 decision in Diamond v. Chakrabarty,[95] holding that genetically engineered microorganisms can be patented. This\ndecision contributed to a revolution in\nbiotechnology that has resulted in the issuance of thousands of patents, the\nformation of hundreds of new companies, and the development of thousands of\nbioengineered plants and foodproducts.[96]\nOutside of\npatent law, however, the role of the US courts in shaping regulatory policy\nwith respect to GMOs has been limited. A common theme among many court\ndecisions on GMOs has been the judiciarys deference to agency expertise in\ndetermining how to regulatethem.\nThe Supreme\nCourts decision in Monsanto Co. v. Geertson Seed Farms[97] involved a challenge under NEPA to APHISs decision to issue a determination of\nnonregulated status to Monsantos Roundup Ready Alfalfa (RRA), a genetically\nengineered variety of alfalfa, after making a finding of no significant\nimpact determination instead of preparing an environmental impact statement\n(EIS). The district court ruled that an EIS was required, and as a remedy\nenjoined APHIS from deregulating RRA, in whole or in part, pending completion\nof the EIS, and also enjoining almost all planting of RRA nationwide.[98]\nThe Supreme Court reversed, ruling that the district court exceeded its\nauthority in enjoining APHIS from partially deregulating RRA and enjoining the\nplanting of RRA. It concluded that APHIS should be allowed to structure a\npartial deregulation order while completing the EIS.[99]\nIn Alliance\nfor Bio-Integrity v. Shalala,[100] the plaintiffs challenged the FDAs 1992 policy statement that GMO foods that are similar to conventional varieties would\nbe presumptively deemed generally recognized as safe (GRAS)[101] and that they need not be labeled.[102] The district court declined to\nrule that the FDAs decision that genetic modification does not materially\nalter foods and to presume GMO foods are GRAS was arbitrary and capricious,\nstating that the rational for [court] deference [to agency decision making] is\nparticularly strong when the [agency] is evaluating scientific data within its\ntechnical expertise.[103]\nAs to labeling, it said that given FDAs decision on the GRAS issue, it would\nalso find that the FDAs interpretation of the FFDCAs labeling requirement was\nreasonable.[104]\nOther GMO cases have\nsimilarly displayed the tendency of US courts to defer to agency\ndecisionmaking.[105]\nBack to Top\nLuis Acosta\nSenior Legal\nInformation Analyst\nMarch 2014\n[1] Pew Initiative on Food and\nBiotechnology, Guide to U.S. Regulation of Genetically Modified Food and\nAgricultural Biotechnology Products 6 (Sept. 2001), http://www.pewtrusts.org/uploadedFiles/www\npewtrustsorg/Reports/Food_and_Biotechnology/hhs_biotech_0901.pdf.\n[2] The Biotechnology Industry in the United States, Select USA, http://selectusa.commerce.gov/print/industry-snapshots/biotechnology-industry-united-states (last visited Nov. 5, 2013) (stating there are 1300 firms and 1.3 million\nemployees in biosciences in the US, and 5.8 million employees in related\nindustry sectors).\n[3] Intl Serv. for the Acquisition of Agri-Biotech\nApplications, ISAAA Brief No.\n44-2012, Global Status of Commercial Biotech/GM Crops, Executive\nSummary, http://www.isaaa.org/resources/publications/briefs/44/\nexecutivesummary/default.asp (last visited Nov. 5, 2013).\n[4] Economic Research Service, Adoption of Genetically Engineered Crops in the\nUS, Recent Trends in GE Adoption, United\nStates Department of Agriculture, http://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/adoption-of-genetically-engineered-crops-in-the-us/recent-trends-in-ge-adoption.aspx#.UobvBXL92Dk (July 9, 2013).\n[5] Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety to the Convention on Biological Diversity, Jan.\n29, 2000, 39 I.L.M. 1027, http://bch.cbd.int/protocol/text/; Parties to the Protocol and Signature and Ratification of the Supplementary\nProtocol, Convention on Biological\nDiversity, http://bch.cbd.int/protocol/parties/ (last updated Sept. 10, 2012).\n[6] Bureau of Oceans and International Environmental and Scientific Affairs, Frequently\nAsked Questions on the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety (CPB), U.S. Department of State (Feb. 23,\n2004), http://2001-2009.state.gov/g/\noes/rls/or/2004/29751.htm.\n[7] See, e.g., id.
