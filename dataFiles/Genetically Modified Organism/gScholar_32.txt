Genetically Modified Organisms in FoodScreening and Specific Detection by Polymerase Chain ReactionSabine Vollenhofer ,* Kornel Burg , Josef Schmidt , and Hans Kroath Austrian Research Centers Seibersdorf, Biotechnology Unit, A-2444 Seibersdorf, Austria J. Agric. Food Chem., 1999, 47 (12), pp 50385043DOI: 10.1021/jf990353lPublication Date (Web): November 11, 1999Copyright  1999 American Chemical SocietyAbstract PCR methods for the detection of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) were developed that can be used for screening purposes and for specific detection of glyphosate-tolerant soybean and insect-resistant maize in food. Primers were designed to amplify parts of the 35S promoter derived from Cauliflower Mosaic Virus, the NOS terminator derived from Agrobacterium tumefaciens and the antibiotic marker gene NPTII (neomycin-phosphotransferase II), to allow for general screening of foods. PCR/hybridization protocols were established for the detection of glyphosate-tolerant RoundUp Ready soybean and insect-resistant Bt-maize. Besides hybridization, confirmation of the results using restriction analysis was also possible. The described methods enabled a highly sensitive and specific detection of GMOs and thus provide a useful tool for routine analysis of raw and processed food products.
