Quantitative analysis of genetically modified organisms (GMO) in processed food by PCR-based methodsA. Wurz, , A. Bluth, P. Zeltz, C. Pfeifer, R. Willmund Gene-Scan GmbH, Btzinger Strasse 29, D-79111 Freiburg, GermanyReceived 6 April 1999, Accepted 13 April 1999, Available online 8 December 1999AbstractTwo different PCR-based approaches for the quantitative analysis of genetically modified organism (GMO)  components in foods are presented using Soybean derived samples as an example. The first method  a double competitive PCR  is well suited to determine threshold levels of GMO content in food. The other  PCR on-line measurement  is suited to determine ratios of transgenic versus non-transgenic component. Both methods provide a means to alleviate the problems of standardisation encountered with simple qualitative PCR approaches and will allow to cope with threshold levels for GMO, once issued by legislative bodies.KeywordsGenetically modified organism; Food; PCR; Quantitative analysis1. IntroductionThe most important prerequisites for the application of PCR-based detection methods are complete knowledge on the foreign genetic construct within the genetically modified organism (GMO) to be detected and the ability to extract significant amounts of amplifiable DNA from the sample to be investigated. Provided these two prerequisites are fulfilled, PCR-based detection methods can rapidly be designed for virtually any GMO within short of time. Generally this holds true also for quantitative approaches although more time is needed for development and validation. In fact availability of suitable reference material and criteria for standardisation rather constitute a bottle-neck at present.So far, only qualitative methods for GMO detection have been standardised. But still inter-laboratory variability is substantial as variations in DNA-extraction efficiency and inhibitory effects can occur, thus needing careful monitoring.Quantitative methods for the analysis of pure raw materials using competitive PCR have recently been developed and evaluated (see contribution of P. Hbner). They are based on the quantification of the DNA submitted to PCR (e.g., by photometric means) and subsequent measurement of the transgene specific DNA content using competitive PCR. These methods decrease inter-laboratory variation dramatically and the problem of false negatives due to inhibitory effects is eliminated by defining sensitivity of PCR with the internal competitor. One remaining problem is, that the quality of DNA (fragmentation or chemical modification) and the extent of contained non-chromosomal DNA (tissue-specific) cannot be addressed by these means. This makes it necessary to standardise the method for each single food matrix separately. Furthermore only pure matrices (derived from one organism) can be analysed (in terms of relative GMO content).In general with processed food it is more difficult to obtain significant amounts of amplifiable DNA as heat treatment, enzymatic activities or acidic pH lead to fragmentation and other modifications of DNA (see also Hupfer et al., 1998).In addition, the analysis of mixed samples or end products needs to determine relative proportions of GMO with respect to a certain food component e.g., the proportion of Roundup Ready Soy (RRS) in the whole soybean fraction within the sample. To determine this ratio in the example of RRS, the RRS specific DNA and the general soy specific DNA (as a reference) has to be determined, thus allowing a ratio to be calculated.The two methods presented below, make use of the soybean lectin le1 gene as a general soybean gene, that has already been exploited for other food related issues (e.g., Mayer et al., 1996).The first method uses a double competitive PCR approach in which the RRS DNA and the general soy DNA content are measured by two independent competitive PCR's. The second is a quantitative approach using on-line PCR measurement using the so-called TaqMan technique on a Abi-Prism 7700 device (Anonymous, 1997); alternatively other on-line methods e.g., using the fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) principle could also be used.2. Material and methodsFor the double competitive PCR approach the RRS specific detection was performed essentially as described by Wurz and Willmund (1997). An internal standard consisting in a synthetic amplicon with identical Primer binding sites was reamplified and cloned yielding an amplicon with the following sequence:For the lectin le1 specific detection (see also Wurz et al., 1998) primers were: Forward (5-GACGCTATTGTGACCTCCTC-3) and reverse (5-TGTCAGGGGCATAGAAGGTG-3). The standard amplicon was cloned after introducing a deletion using a linker primer, yielding the following amplicon:All PCR's were run on a PerkinElmer GeneAmp 9700 or 2400 in 25 l reactions with 1U of Amplitaq Gold polymerase for 10 min/95C followed by 50 cycles of [25 s/94C, 30 s/62C, 45 s/72C] and a final 7 min/72C.For the TaqMan approach the same amplicons were used with exception of the reverse lectin le1 primer being 5-TGTCAGGGGCATAGAAGGTG-3 to ensure amplicons for both systems being approximately of the same size. This is to avoid bias caused by highly fragmented DNA as template (as may occur in processed foods). Internal probes labelled 5-FAM and 3TAMRA were used for detection during a standard two step PCR-profile of 10 min/95C followed by 50 cycles of [15s./95C, 1min/60C] on an AbiPrism 7700.Cloning and post-PCR steps were performed according to standard procedures. DNA samples from soya reference material (Fluka 85,473) were prepared using a WIZARD or CTAB based methods.3. Results3.1. Double competitive PCRAt present no reference material for mixed food samples is available but, as is obvious, non-soy derived DNA will not interfere with the method presented in this chapter.DNA was extracted from Fluka 0.5% and 2% GMO soya reference material. Using competitive PCR on the lectin le1 gene, the lectin gene copy number was estimated in a first step for both samples (data not shown, for pure products OD 260 measurement can also be used).DNA extracts were then diluted accordingly, in order to match a lectin competitor-concentration matching 25,000 copies of the lectin amplicon per reaction. A second PCR specific for RRS was carried out, using the same amount of sample DNA and an amount of competitor matching 250 copies of the RR specific amplicon (for convenience the two competitors are used as premixed solution in defined ratios, yielding equivalent band intensities with defined copy numbers of the targets e.g., for 1% RR soy as in the example shown in Fig. 1). The PCR products were then separated and visualized on an agarose Gel by ethidiumbomide staining (Fig. 1).Fig. 1.It shows the amplification products after coamplification of the same volumes of DNA extracted from 0.5% (Lanes 14) and 2% (Lanes 58) Fluka reference material together with 25,000 copies of lectin le1 competitor using the lectin specific primers (Lanes 12 and 56) and 250 copies of the RRS specific competitor using the RRS specific Primers (Lanes 34 and 78) Two parallel PCR are shown for each sample. The upper bands represent the two original amplicons the lower ones represent the two (smaller) competitor amplicons. In Lanes 12 and 56 lectin le1 is matched as indicated by same band intesities for both amplicons in the reaction. In Lanes 34 the competitor band is stronger than the original RRS band thus indicating that the sample is below 1% RRS. In Lanes 78 the competitor signal is weaker, thus indicating the sample to be above 1% in RRS content.Figure optionsDownload full-size imageDownload as PowerPoint slideBy simply comparing the band intensities a sample can easily be evaluated with respect to the threshold that was predefined in the experiment.Theoretically this technique may also allow the determination of exact values of the ratio of the two targets to be determined, but using such a simple non-radioactive approach and a competitor amplicon differing substantially in length would need substantial effort to do so. The generation of calibration curves is rather complex and the densitometric measurement suffers from general problems in connection with staining-properties, diffusion phenomena etc. Thus this technique will be rather suited for threshold determinations than for calculation of actual ratios.
