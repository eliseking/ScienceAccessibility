3Q 2016GMO Quarterly LetterHellish Choices:
What’s An Asset Owner To Do? 
Ben Inker 

Executive Summary
Given today’s low yields and high valuations across almost all asset classes, there are no particularly 
good outcomes available for investors. We believe that either valuations will revert to historically 
normal levels and near-term returns will be very bad, or valuations will remain elevated relative 
to history. If valuations remain elevated indefinitely, near-term returns will be less bad but still 
insufficient for investors to achieve their goals. Furthermore, given elevated valuations in the long 
term, long-term returns will also be insufficient for investors to achieve their goals. It would be very 
handy to know which scenario will play out, as the reversion versus no reversion scenarios have 
important implications both for the appropriate portfolio to run today and critical institution-level 
decisions that investors will be forced to make in the future. Unfortunately, we believe there is no 
certainty as to which scenario will play out. As a result, we believe it is prudent for investors to try to 
build portfolios that are robust to either outcome and start contingency planning for the possibility 
that long-term returns will be meaningfully lower than what is necessary for their current saving/
contribution and spending plans to be sustainable.

Introduction
Over the past few years, my colleague James Montier and I have written extensively on the possibility 
that there has been a permanent shift in the investment landscape.1 The investment landscape today 
is an unprecedented one, where we believe it is not so much that asset prices look mispriced relative 
to one another (although some of that is going on) but that almost all asset classes are priced at 
valuations that seem to guarantee returns lower than history. Our standard forecasting approach 
assumes that this situation will gradually dissipate, such that seven years from now valuations will 
be back to historical norms. James calls this scenario Purgatory because it means a finite period of 
pain, followed by a return to better conditions for investors. An alternative possibility, which James 
refers to as Hell, is that valuations have permanently shifted higher, leaving nearer-term returns to 
asset classes somewhat better than our standard methodology would suggest, but at the expense of 
lower long-term returns. By now some of our clients are probably thoroughly sick of hearing about 
the topic, but this piece is going to delve into it yet again, because the question of whether we are 
in Purgatory or Hell is a crucial one, not only for its implications for what portfolio is the right one 
for an investor to hold at the moment, but also for the institutional choices investors have to make 
that go well beyond simple asset allocation. In his letter this quarter, Jeremy Grantham is exploring 

1 James has, however, consistently suggested that the possibility of a permanent shift is fairly low.

3Q 2016GMO Quarterly Lettera slightly different version of the Hell scenario. His version of Hell is driven more by weaknesses in 
the arbitrage that should force asset prices back to equilibrium rather than changes to discount rates, 
but it has similar implications for investors and institutions.
The distinction between Purgatory and Hell is an important one, because each scenario creates different 
challenges for investors. In short, Purgatory creates an important investment dilemma today, as the 
“optimal” portfolio looks strikingly different from traditional portfolios. If we are in Hell, by contrast, 
traditional portfolios are not obviously wrong today, but the basic assumptions investors make about 
their sustainable spending rates are dangerously incorrect. These twin issues – the implications for 
today’s portfolios and the implications for institutional decisions into the future – are crucial for 
us  in  the Asset Allocation  group  at  GMO. And  they  are  the  reason  why  most  of  the  investment 
conversations I have had with my colleague John Thorndike2 over the past few months have either 
been on this topic or have been impacted by the dilemma of which scenario to assume. The rest of 
this paper is largely a summary of our discussions on the topic, which we recently presented at our 
annual client conference.

Why all the discussion of Hell?
There are a couple of important points to make about why we spend so much time discussing the 
Hell scenario today when we have not done so in the past. The first is that we would likely not be 
discussing it at all if it did not seem to be priced into the market. If asset prices today were generally 
clustered around normal valuation levels, we would spend very little time concerning ourselves with 
the possibility that all assets would simultaneously rise in price and valuation to a new high plateau, 
which would, in the future, be considered normal. In other words, we run the risk here of making the 
same mistake that we have accused plenty of other investors of making in the past, trying to justify 
the price level of an overvalued market with those ever dangerous words “This time is different.”  
The second is that unlike many points in history, the change to the expected returns to assets involved 
in going from a Purgatory scenario to a Hell scenario has very important implications for the correct 
portfolio to hold today. Even had you known in 2000 or 2003 or 2007 whether the future was going to 
evolve consistent with the Purgatory scenario versus the Hell scenario, you would not have needed to 
run a particularly different portfolio. Today’s portfolio is much more profoundly different depending 
on which you think is correct. And finally, Hell goes beyond being merely an “investment problem” 
into the realm of being an “institutional problem,” with implications for foundations, endowments, 
pension funds, and individual savers that are much broader than the simple question of what portfolio 
is the right one to run today.

Purgatory and Hell, the seven-year view
Our standard assumptions for long-term asset class returns are that equities should deliver 5.5-6% 
above inflation in the long run, bonds 2.5-3% above inflation, and cash 1-1.5% above inflation. These 
assumptions are broadly consistent with the long-term returns to each of these assets, and embody 
what we feel are appropriate premia for bonds and stocks above cash, given the risks that each impose 
on holders. The assumptions for Hell are 1.25% lower equilibrium returns across the board. In other 
words, in Hell the equilibrium return on cash is 0% real and risk premia are otherwise left unchanged. 
The implications for our asset class expected returns over the next seven years are shown in Exhibit 1.

allocation portfolios.

As you can see, for all assets other than cash, expected returns are higher in Hell than in Purgatory. 
This is because, other than cash, these are all reasonably long-duration assets, and gains made by not 
having to fall to the lower valuations of Purgatory outweigh the lower income generated by the fact 
that valuations are higher on average over the period. An assumption of higher ending valuations will 
always make for higher expected returns over a seven-year period for stocks and bonds. But for much 
of history, this wouldn’t necessarily have affected the correct portfolio to hold. Exhibit 2 shows the 
result from a simple optimization given our standard 7-year forecasts as of June 2000 and the result 
if we adjusted the forecasts for the Hell terminal assumptions.3 

3 For Exhibits 2, 3, and 4, these are standard mean variance optimizations with all of the standard problems involved.  In 
order to keep them from being silly, I put limits on asset classes similar to what we would actually do in our Benchmark-
Free Allocation Strategy.  For those playing along at home, the covariance matrix is “cheating” based on realized returns 
for the period 1995-2015 and the lambda is 1.35, which makes for approximately a 60% equity/40% bond split at 
equilibrium returns.  The optimizations are using a subset of the asset classes we forecast, focusing on the broad regions 
but, other than quality in the US, ignoring style and size sectors.  The reason we needed to make an exception for 
quality is that without it, there were no equities worth buying in 2007, which would make the resulting portfolio quite 
qualitatively different than the one we actually ran at the time.

While the expected returns are different for the two scenarios, they have no impact on the desired 
portfolio, which winds up buying as much emerging equity, emerging debt, and TIPS as it is allowed, 
with the rest in US government bonds. In 2007, the impact of Purgatory versus Hell is slightly larger, 
as shown in Exhibit 3.

The basic difference is how much you want to have in quality stocks – 10% versus 30%. Interestingly, 
despite a 20% swing in the amount in equities, the expected volatility and duration of the portfolios 
winds up quite similar, and the expected returns are exactly the same in Purgatory and only differ by 
0.4% annualized in Hell. The duration I am calculating for these portfolios is the version I used in the 
Q2 2016 Letter “The Duration Connection.”  It takes the basic concept of duration – sensitivity of 
the price of an asset to changes in the discount rate – and applies it to all assets, not just fixed income 
assets. The specific durations I am using are identical to the ones I used in that letter.

The Hell portfolio has 58% in risky assets versus 36% for the Purgatory portfolio. It has almost twice 
3
the expected volatility and close to three times the duration. And while the two portfolios have similar 
expected returns if Purgatory turns out to be the correct forecast, the difference between the two in 
Hell is 1.3% per year for seven years. Another way to look at it is if you pick the Purgatory portfolio 
and it turns out we are in Hell, you will only break even with a more traditional 60% stock/40% bond 
portfolio. If you run the Hell portfolio and it turns out we are in Purgatory, you are taking almost 
twice the volatility and expected loss in a depression, and almost three times the portfolio duration 
for no benefit in expected return.
What can an investor do to try to solve this problem?  At first blush, risk parity seems like it might be 
a solution. After all, risk parity avoids the task of forecasting in the first place. We don’t think it helps, 
though. One reason is that the fact that a strategy does not involve forecasting doesn’t mean that 
expected returns for assets don’t impact the expected return of the strategy. And today we believe that 
risk parity has two problems on that front. The first is that global government bonds have a negative 
expected return versus cash in either Purgatory or Hell.4 The second is that the duration of many risk 
parity portfolios is extremely long today. Part of the reason this has occurred is because the duration 
of government bonds has lengthened as yields have fallen. But the issue has been amplified by the 
fact that volatilities have been low and correlations between stocks and bonds quite negative, which 
means risk parity portfolios that key off of portfolio volatility targets have been levering up. This long 
duration means that such risk parity portfolios are particularly vulnerable to any rise in the general 
level of discount rates for asset classes, and their vulnerability is greater in both absolute terms and 
relative to a 60% stock/40% bond portfolio than has generally been the case over the last 40 years. 
Exhibit 5 shows the duration of a simple stock/bond risk parity portfolio against a 60/40 portfolio 
over time. 

4 This is another way of saying that government bond markets are pricing in a more extreme scenario than Hell.  It is 
certainly not impossible that the world evolves in a way even more extreme than our Hell scenario, but a belief in a 
positive term premium for government bonds today is not merely a statement that “this time is different,” but “this time 
is extremely different.”  Given that today’s levels are a complete outlier relative to history, we are contemplating that 
prices will only partially revert back to the old normal.  Actually liking government bonds today basically requires that 
things stay as extreme as they currently are.

Interestingly, the portfolios actually had similar duration for a good deal of the last 40 years. We have 
shaded in the period from 1970-2005 as the “in sample” period for risk parity, because that is often 
the period that risk parity managers seem to show for their backtests. Today is not the first time a 
significant gap has opened between the two, but it means that the risk parity portfolio today makes 
sense only if the future is meaningfully more extreme than our Hell scenario and that it is particularly 
vulnerable to losses should the future turn out to be more similar to history than that. Risk parity has 
not shown any particular “skill” in timing its duration exposure as it has generally done worse relative 
to a 60/40 portfolio when its duration has been particularly long, as we can see in Exhibit 6.

We believe a better solution is to focus on robustness rather than optimality and build a portfolio 
that will do decently in either scenario. There are no silver bullets available today, but we can work 
to bridge the gap between the Purgatory and Hell portfolios. One weapon we can make use of that 

6

GMO Quarterly Letter: 3Q 2016can help is alternatives. I wrote about alternatives in last quarter’s letter,5 and as a quick recap, they 
have the virtue that with a generally shorter duration than traditional assets, their returns are much 
less  sensitive  to  which  scenario  plays  out.  In  our  Benchmark-Free Allocation  Strategy  we  have 
approximately 20% in alternatives today, which is at the high end of our historical range for such 
assets.  But  unless  we  were  willing  to  move  the  portfolio  to  be  predominantly  alternatives,  there 
is only so much they can do to bridge the gap. The rest of the work is being done in a less flashy 
way, through compromise. Our actual portfolios are somewhat more complicated than the simple 
examples I used here to demonstrate the difference between the optimal portfolios for today, but the 
gist is the same. If the right portfolio for Purgatory today has about 35% in risky assets and the Hell 
portfolio has around 60%, our current portfolio has about 50%.6 This means we are running more 
risk than is optimal if this is Purgatory and are leaving some return on the table if this is Hell. But the 
Benchmark-Free portfolio is designed with the goal of having the same expected return in Purgatory 
as the optimal Purgatory portfolio, only about 0.5% per year worse than the Hell portfolio in the Hell 
scenario, and has materially less duration, depression risk, and volatility than a traditional portfolio. It 
may not be strictly optimal for either Purgatory or Hell, but it does allow us to be more philosophical 
about our uncertainty over which scenario will play out over the next seven years.

Purgatory and Hell, the 30-year view
Over seven years, Hell is a less negative scenario than Purgatory because the capital losses associated 
with falling valuations are smaller. Over 30 years, however, the positions reverse. Given the longer 
time horizon, the lower income available from stocks and bonds outweighs the benefit of valuations 
falling by less. Exhibit 7 shows the 30-year forecasts for the Purgatory and Hell scenarios in both real 
(inflation adjusted) and nominal terms.

The forecasts are worse for every asset in Hell, although for equities (given their long durations) the 
differences are not particularly large. One point that becomes immediately clear from these forecasts 
is that earning the 5% real return that endowments and foundations and savers are counting on, or 
the approximately 7.3% nominal return that defined benefit pension funds are assuming on average, 
is going to be extremely difficult. While a few institutions have been able to generate the kind of 
outperformance that it would take to turn these forecasts into an acceptable outcome, it would be 
impossible  for  institutions  as  a  whole  to  do  so. Alpha  of  that  kind  is  predominantly  a  zero  sum 
game. It is certainly possible for a well-resourced, talented, and hard-working investment staff to 
field a group of active managers to outperform their respective asset classes, as evidenced by Yale 
University’s endowment returns over the last 30 years. But active managers in aggregate have not, 
will not, and cannot meaningfully outperform their asset classes in the long run. This means that 
whether we are in Purgatory or Hell, institutions have a very big problem today. 
The nature of that problem is different in Purgatory and Hell, however. In the Purgatory scenario, 
returns for the next seven years will be inadequate, but after that, the world reverts to a “normal” 
pattern and the old rules apply. Exhibit 8 shows the value of a corpus starting at $1 million and with 
the spending rules of a private foundation in the “normal” scenario and the Purgatory scenario. This 
assumes a traditional 60/40 portfolio.

The bad news is that the real value of the corpus falls about 36% over the next seven years as returns 
are far below the 5% real return required in the long run. But the good news is that it is at least a 
finite problem. The value of the corpus will fall for a while, but at least at the end of that period it 
reaches stability again. As my colleague John Thorndike has put it, this means that Purgatory is an 
“investment problem.”  By this, John means that the basic institutional rules that investors have lived 
by, with regard to pay-outs, investment policy and the rest, are still valid in the long run. The problem 
for the next seven years is how to mitigate the pain. 
If we truly turn out to be in Hell, the problem is quite different. Exhibit 9 is the same idea as Exhibit 
8, but also shows the flight path of Hell over time.

GMO Quarterly Letter: 3Q 2016The losses for a traditional 60/40 portfolio are less severe in the Hell scenario for the next seven years, 
but the trouble does not end with year seven. If we are in Hell, the basic math for foundations simply 
fails. A 60/40 portfolio has no hope of delivering the 5% real that the foundation needs to pay out over 
time, and in fact no combination of stocks and bonds will get you to 5% real, because the equilibrium 
for stocks is only 4.5% real in Hell, and they are the highest-expected-return asset. This means, in 
John’s terminology, that Hell is an “institutional problem.” The basic assumption that the foundation 
could  expect  to  live  on  in  perpetuity  becomes  false. Translating  to  the  endowment  problem,  the 
spending rate that preserves intergenerational fairness has fallen materially. For someone saving for 
retirement, the required savings rate has just risen markedly, because not only is the pot of retirement 
savings going to be growing more slowly than expected, but the safe spending rate for a given pool 
of savings in retirement has just fallen. For a defined benefit pension plan, making reasonable if 
arbitrary assumptions of a duration of 15.5 and payouts over 30 years, if it was fully funded at a 7.3% 
expected return, the funded status drops to 80% in Purgatory and 67% in Hell. 

Conclusion
Both Purgatory and Hell are bad outcomes for investors, but we believe the basic point is that from 
today’s valuation levels, there are no good outcomes for investors. In the nearer term, maintaining 
today’s  high  valuation  levels  implies  less  pain  for  investors.  But  as  the  time  horizon  lengthens, 
the lower cash flows associated with higher valuations bite more and more, so the longer the time 
horizon, the more mean reversion of valuations is a positive rather than a negative. In the long run, 
we can hope that valuations fall to historically normal levels, because only if that happens will the 
institutional business models and savings and investing heuristics that institutions and savers have 
built still be valid. 
But it is difficult to dismiss the possibility that this time actually is different. While all periods in which 
asset prices move well away from historical norms on valuations have a narrative that explains why 
the shift is rational and permanent, I would argue that this time is more different than most. Whether 
we are talking about 1989 in Japan, 2000 in the US, or 2007 globally, what bubbles generally have in 
common is that the narratives require the suspension of some fundamental rules of capitalism. They 
require either large permanent gaps between the cost of capital and return on capital, or some group 
of investors to voluntarily settle for far lower returns than they could get in other assets with similar 
or less risk. Today’s market has an internal consistency that those markets lack. If there has been a 
permanent drop of discount rates of perhaps 1.5 percentage points, then market prices are generally 
close enough to fair value that you can explain away the discrepancies as business as usual. That does 
not mean that the drop in discount rates actually is permanent. Markets are notorious for a lack of 
imagination about how the future can differ from the present. But the models that purport to explain 
the “natural” level of short-term interest rates generally show neither much ability to explain history 
nor have a lot of theoretical appeal to them. This means we have poor guides for what short-term 
interest rates “should” be. Sadly, I believe that includes the model of “whatever rates have been on 
average over the last N years,” which is the market historian’s default model for the future. That 
makes it hard to dismiss an argument that the rate has changed in a durable way, even if the argument 
that the change will be durable is a largely speculative one. 
Will the future look like the Hell scenario?  We hope not. While it is better for the next few years, 
the longer-run implications are fairly bleak. But hope is not an investment strategy. We believe that 
today it is irresponsible not to at least contemplate the possibility of Hell in building a portfolio, and 

10

GMO Quarterly Letter: 3Q 2016likewise it is irresponsible for institutions not to contemplate the possibility of Hell when thinking of 
their broader decisions. For our part, we work first to try to build the right portfolios for our clients, 
and today our idea of how to do that is to build a portfolio that is robust to either outcome. 
But we also consider it part of our job to help advise our clients beyond the portfolios we run, and the 
Hell scenario is a possibility that few, if any, investors are truly prepared for. Savers and institutions 
had a very nasty shock when 2008-09 happened to their portfolios. But in some ways it was easy 
to  deal  with.  Having  a  30-40%  hole  blown  out  of  your  portfolio  suddenly  causes  plenty  of  soul 
searching and difficult decisions. But the need for the decisions is so obvious that everyone involved 
knows something needs to be done, and done fairly quickly. Hell, on the other hand, will creep up 
slowly. The problem will not be a giant drop in the value of the portfolio, but serial disappointment 
in returns that doesn’t amount to a lot in a single year. Only the accumulation of disappointing years 
and a slowly shrinking corpus/falling funded status/inadequate accumulation of retirement savings 
will make clear the depth of the problem. 
The trouble is that by the time it is obvious in a 2008-09 sense that something is badly wrong, investors 
will have wasted a lot of time that could have been used to mitigate the problem if only they had 
acted. One unfortunate feature of the institutional landscape is that there will be very little praise and 
no lack of scorn for those who are first to move in the necessary direction to survive Hell. The pension 
fund CIO who recommends moving expected returns from 7.3% to 4.5% is overwhelmingly more 
likely to be fired than lauded. But ignoring reality does not change reality. While the circumstances 
in which Jeremy Grantham wrote “Reinvesting When Terrified” were quite different than today’s 
daunting prospects for institutions, his advice nevertheless is still completely true. “There is only one 
cure for terminal paralysis: you absolutely must have a battle plan… and stick to it.”7 Even if there 
is too much uncertainty about which scenario we are facing as investors to know exactly the perfect 
plan for today’s portfolio and for tomorrow’s institutional dilemmas, now is exactly the time we need 
to start building our battle plans for the challenges we will be facing in the coming years.

(and other stuff)
Jeremy Grantham

Preamble
Rather like a parrot I have been repeating for 10 quarters now my belief that we would not have a 
traditional bubble burst in the US equity market until we had reached at least 2300 on the S&P, the 
threshold level of major bubbles in the past, and at least until we had reached the election. Well, we 
are close on both counts now. My passionate hope was that I would then, perhaps 6 months after the 
election, recommend a major sidestep of the coming deluge that would conveniently have arrived 
6 to 12 months later, allowing us then, after a 50% decline, to leap back into cheap equity markets 
enthusiastically, more enthusiastically, that is, than we did last time in 2009. Thus we would save 
many of our clients tons of money as we had (eventually) in the 2000 bust, at least for those clients 
who stayed with us for the ride, and in 2007. I consider myself a bubble historian and one who is 
eager to see one form and break: I have often said that they are the only really important events in 
investing. 
I have come to believe, however, very reluctantly, that we bubble historians have, together with much 
of the market, been a bit brainwashed by our exposure in the last 30 years to 4 of the perhaps 6 or 8 
great investment bubbles in history: Japanese land and Japanese equities in 1989, US tech in 2000, 
and more or less everything in 2007. For bubble historians eager to see pins used on bubbles and 
spoiled by the prevalence of bubbles in the last 30 years, it is tempting to see them too often. Well, 
the US market today is not a classic bubble, not even close.  The market is unlikely to go “bang” in 
the way those bubbles did. It is far more likely that the mean reversion will be slow and incomplete. 
The consequences are dismal for investors: we are likely to limp into the setting sun with very low 
returns. For bubble historians, though, it is heartbreaking for there will be no histrionics, no chance 
of being a real hero. Not this time. 
The 2300 level on the S&P 500, which marks the 2-standard-deviation (2-sigma) point on historical 
data that has effectively separated real bubbles from mere bull markets, is in this case quite possibly 
a red herring. It is comparing today’s much higher pricing environment to history’s far lower levels. 
I  have  made  much  of  the  convenience  of  2-sigma  in  the  past  as  it  has  brought  some  apparent 
precision to the more touchy-feely definition of a true bubble: excellent fundamentals irrationally 
extrapolated. Now, when this definition conflicts with the 2-sigma measurement – ironically, it was 
chosen partly because it had never conflicted before – I apparently prefer the less statistical test. But 
you can imagine the trepidation with which I do this.

3Q 2016GMO Quarterly LetterHidden by the great bubbles of 2000 and 2007, another, much slower-burning but perhaps even more 
powerful force, has been exerting itself: a 35-year downward move in rates (see Exhibit 1), which, 
with persistent help from the Fed over the last 20 years and a shift in the global economy, has led to 
a general drop in the discount rate applied to almost all assets. They now all return 2-2.5% less than 
they did in the 1955 to 1995 era (or, as far as we can tell from incomplete data, from 1900 to 1995).

This broad shift in available returns gives rise to the question of what constitutes fair value in this 
changed world; will prices regress back toward the more traditional levels?  And if they do, will it be 
fast or slow? 
Another contentious question is whether abnormally high US profit margins will also regress, and, if 
so, by how much and how fast?  (This will be discussed in more detail next quarter.)
Counterintuitively,  it  turns  out  that  the  implications  for  the  next  20  years  for  pension  funds  and 
others are oddly similar whether the market crashes in 2 years, falls steadily over 7 years, or whimpers 
sideways for 20 years. The real difference in these flight paths will be, of course, over the short term. 
Are we going to have our pain from regression to the mean in an intense 2-year burst, a steady 7-year 
decline, or a drawn-out 20-year whimper?   
The caveat here is that while I am very confident in saying that we are not in a traditional bubble today, 
all the other arguments below are more in the nature of thought experiments or, less grandly, simply 
thinking aloud. I am asking you – especially you value managers – to think through with me some of 
these varied possibilities and their implications. What follows is my attempt to answer these, for me, 
very uncomfortable questions.
The Case for a Whimper

1.  Classic  investment  bubbles  require  abnormally  favorable  fundamentals  in  areas 
such as productivity, technology, employment, and capacity utilization. They usually 
require a favorable geo-political environment as well. But these very favorable factors 
alone are not enough. 

2.  Investment  bubbles  also  require  investor  euphoria.  This  euphoria  is  typically 
represented  by  a  willingness  to  extrapolate  the  abnormally  favorable  fundamental 
conditions into the distant future. 

13

GMO Quarterly Letter: 3Q 20163.  The euphoric phases of these epic bull markets have tended to rise at an accelerating 
rate in the final two to three years and to fall even faster. Exhibit 2 shows four of my 
all-time favorites. True euphoric bubbles have no sound economic underpinning and 
so are particularly vulnerable to sudden bursting when some unexpected bad news 
occurs or when selling just starts… “comes in from the country” as they said in 1929.

4.  We have been extremely spoiled in the last 30 years by experiencing 4 of perhaps the 
best 8 classic bubbles known to history. For me, the order of seniority is, from the 
top: Japanese land, Japanese stocks in 1989, US tech stocks in 2000, and US housing, 
which  peaked  in  2006  and  shared  the  stage  with  both  the  broadest  international 
equity overpricing (over 1-sigma) ever recorded and a risk/return line for assets that 
appeared to slope backwards for the first time in history – investors actually paid for 
the privilege of taking risk.

5.  What did these four bubbles have in common? Lots of euphoria and unbelievable 
things that were widely believed: Yes, the land under the Emperor’s Palace really did 
equal the real estate value of California. The Japanese market was cheap at 65x said 
the hit squad from Solomon Bros. Their work proved that with their low bond rates, 
the  P/E  should  have  been  100.  The  US  tech  stocks  were  65x.  Internet  stocks  sold 
at many multiples of sales despite a collective loss and Greenspan (hiss) explained 
how the Internet would usher in a new golden age of growth, not the boom and bust 
of  productivity  that  we  actually  experienced.  And  most  institutional  investment 
committees believed it or half believed it! And US house prices, said Bernanke in 
2007, “had never declined,” meaning they never would, and everyone believed him. 
Indeed, the broad public during these four events, two in Japan and two in the US, 
appeared to believe most or all of it. As did the economic and financial establishments, 
especially for the two US bubbles. Certainly only mavericks spoke against them. 

14

GMO Quarterly Letter: 3Q 20166.  Let  me  ask  you:  How  does  that  level  of  euphoria,  of  wishful  thinking,  of  general 
acceptance, compare to today’s stock market in the US? Not very well. The market 
lacks  both  the  excellent  fundamentals  and  the  euphoria  required  to  unreasonably 
extrapolate it. 

7.  Current fundamentals are way below optimal – trend line growth and productivity are 
at such low levels that the usually confident economic establishment is at an obvious 
loss to explain why. Capacity utilization is well below peak and has been falling. There 
is plenty of available labor hiding in the current low participation rate (at a price). 
House building is also far below normal. 

8.  Classic bubbles have always required that the geopolitical world is at least acceptable, 
more usually well above average. Today’s, in contrast, you can easily agree is unusually 
nerve-wracking. 

9.  Far from euphoric extrapolations, the current market has been for a long while and 
remains extremely nervous. Investor trepidation is so great that many are willing to tie 
up money in ultra-safe long-term government bonds that guarantee zero real return 
rather than buy the marginal share of stock! Cash reserves are high and traditional 
measures of speculative confidence are low. Most leading commentators are extremely 
bearish. The net effect of this nervousness is shown in the last two and a half years of the 
struggling US market shown in Exhibit 3, so utterly unlike the end of the classic bubbles.

10. I just finished a meeting on credit cycles in which yet another difference between 
today’s conditions and a classic bubble was revealed: They – the bubbles in stocks 
and houses – all coincided with bubbles in credit. Exhibits 4 and 5 show the classic 
spike in credit in Japan in 1989, coincident with the high in stocks; the US 2000 tech 
event and the US housing boom of 2006 also coincided perfectly with booms in credit. 
Whether stock and house prices rising draws out credit or credit pushes prices, or 

15

GMO Quarterly Letter: 3Q 2016whether both interact, which seems more likely, is a story for someone else to tell.  
Credit, needless to say, is complex and there are very often individual credit components 
that are worrying. For example, financial corporate debt looks fine, but non-financial 
corporate debt is scary. What is important here is the enormous contrast between the 
credit conditions that previously have been coincident with investment bubbles and 
the lack of a similarly consistent and broad-based credit boom today.

GMO Quarterly Letter: 3Q 201611. The current market therefore is closer to an anti-bubble than a bubble. In every sense, 
that  is,  except  one:  Traditional  measures  of  value  score  this  market  as  extremely 
overpriced by historical standards. 

12. At  GMO  we  have  put  particular  weight  for  identifying  investment  bubbles  on  the 
statistical  measure  of  a  2-sigma  upside  move  above  the  long-term  trend  line,  a 
measure of deviation that uses only long-term prices and volatility around the trend. 
(A 2-sigma deviation occurs every 44 years in a normally distributed world and every 
35 years in our actual fat-tailed stock market world.)  Today’s (November 7) price is 
only 8% away from the 2-sigma level that we calculate for the S&P 500 of 2300. 

13. Upside  moves  of  2-sigma  have  historically  done  an  excellent  job  of  differentiating 
between mere bull markets and the real McCoy investment bubbles that are likely to 
decline a lot – all the way back to trend – often around 50% in equities. And to do so 
in a hurry, in one to three years. 

14. So  we  have  an  apparent  paradox.  None  of  the  usual  economic  or  psychological 
conditions for an investment bubble are being met, yet the current price is almost on 
the statistical boundary of a bubble. Can this be reconciled?  I believe so. 

15. There is a new pressure that has been brought to bear on all asset prices over the last  
35 years and especially the last 20 that has observably driven the general discount rate 
for assets down by 2 to 2.5 percentage points. Tables 1 and 2 compare the approximate 
yields today of major asset classes with the average returns they had from 1945 to 
1995. You can see that available returns to investors are way down. (Let me add here 
that many of these numbers are provisional. We will try to steadily improve them 
over the next several months. Any helpful inputs are welcome.)  But I do believe that 
readers will agree with the general proposition that potential investment returns have 
been lowered on a wide investment front over the last 20 years and that stocks are 
generally in line with all other assets.

16. This downward shift in the discount rate was probably camouflaged for most of us 
by its intersection with two of the great genuine bubbles – 2000 tech and 2007 US 
housing and finance. Those were so much more powerful in the short term and so 
much faster moving that you could easily lose sight of the slower and very irregular 
downward drift in the broad discount rate. Some assets would boom for a few years 
and then bust spectacularly, but all slowly worked their way higher in price and lower 
in yields. 

17. The key point here is that this downward shift in the discount rate has happened and can 
be measured. The possible reasons for it can, for convenience, be divided into two groups. 

18. I believe that the major input has been a sustained policy of the US Fed since just before 
1995 to push down short-term rates. Investors initially resisted this effect, assuming it 
to be very temporary. As the downward pressure on rates continued, though, the 2% 
drop in T-bill rates worked out along the yield curve until, over a number of years, the 
10- to 30-year bonds, both nominal and TIPS, also reflected the 2% drop. This effect, 
rather like a virus, then moved into high-yield stocks, and eventually into all stocks, 
real estate, forests, farming, and all investable assets. The US Fed and its growing list 
of converts to this policy have successfully bullied the entire discount rate structure 
of assets. They did it to enjoy the economic benefit from the wealth effect, and Yellen, 
Bernanke, and Greenspan – the three members of this new Fed regime – all overtly 
bragged about their success in driving asset prices, particularly stocks, higher. 

19. The  general  downward  pressure  on  rates  was  not  continuous.  On  a  cyclical  basis, 
when  growth  and  employment  were  fine,  rates  could  rise.  Indeed,  from  late  2002 
into 2006 the Fed raised rates as much as 430 basis points as the economy recovered, 

18

GMO Quarterly Letter: 3Q 2016following the time-honored practice. Most asset prices, though, far from stumbling, 
continued to rise as the markets now believed that the Fed would always act as if it 
were looking for an excuse to lower rates. Vitally, moral hazard, “the Fed or Greenspan 
put,” was always in sight: If markets rise you are on your own – Whoopee!  But if 
things go wrong – any bump in the economic or market road – you can count on us 
to lower rates. This made investment risks asymmetrical and was guaranteed to raise 
prices. The increasingly miserable rates available to more cautious investors merely 
rubbed this message in. Exhibit 6 makes it pretty clear to me that around the cyclical 
moves the Fed’s pressure ratcheted the rates down − lower highs and lower lows. To 
roughly neutralize for economic cycles the exhibit looks at real interest rates each time 
unemployment hits 5.2% since 1982 and shows earlier cycles only when inflation was 
roughly comparable to today.

20. Exhibit 7 represents the Bank of England’s take on a completely different explanation 
for the lower discount rate: a series of fundamental factors that they argue have pushed 
down “normal” rates 4.5%, far more than the 2% or so reflected in broad asset pricing, 
without a single basis point being allocated to the new policies of central banks. Must 
be the work of, er… central bankers. Some of their points, though, seem reasonable 
enough and might have the right sign at least.

21. A  third  possible  reason  for  low  rates  might  have  been  added  by  Schumpeter,  of 
“Creative Destruction” fame: that we are between waves of innovation and that this 
suppresses growth and the demand for capital. A related school of thought these days 
is that we have simply run out of low-hanging technological fruit. 

22. And, finally, there are those who believe that the reason for lower rates is particularly 
simple and entirely different: The rapidly aging population of the developed world 
and China is, cohort by cohort, moving the mix toward middle-aged heavy savers 
and away from high-consuming young workers. This, they believe, has created excess 
savings that depress all returns on capital. Clearly, not a crazy argument.

23. I believe the dominant effect is Fed policy, but it seems nearly certain that one or 
more of these other factors are also contributing. Whatever fraction was caused by 
Fed actions, the important point here is that we can measure the lower rates and lower 
imputed returns. They are most definitely there. 

24. At GMO our standard assumption for valuing assets has always been that both P/E 
multiples and profitability would move all the way back to “normal” – the long-term 
trend – in seven years. The seven-year period was selected because it was close to the 
historical average. 

25. Now this is where it gets interesting and contentious, for I can find no reason why the 
discount rate this time should return all the way to the old average, nor that it should 
fully regress in only seven years. 

20

GMO Quarterly Letter: 3Q 201626. The case for partial regression of rates hinges on the possibilities that the broad post 
war era of 1945 to 2005 will turn out to have been a golden era of global growth that 
will not be equaled again for at least a couple of decades.  We now appear to be in a 
slower-growing world, the result of a slower-growing and aging population and lower 
productivity. Quite possibly, lower growth and other reasons mentioned above will 
lower the demand for capital and thus result in a permanently lower return on all 
capital, at least to a moderate degree. 

27. The current fad for the Fed and central banks trying to influence the economy through 
lower rates is also unlikely to go away entirely, even over 20 years. Economic dogmas 
die hard despite evidence of failure. Think of all the unnecessary pain and misdirection 
from the idea of Rational Expectations and the Efficient Market Hypothesis.

28. History, though, has shown repeatedly that financial and economic ratios have a strong 
tendency to return to their old, normal levels. These ratios did not spend 100 years 
or so wandering around a central tendency for no reason. This leads me to believe 
that the odds still favor some mean reversion: the discount rate moving toward the 
old normal from today’s extreme. I propose that returning two-thirds of the way to 
the old normal has a higher probability than either returning all the way or staying 
indefinitely at current levels, although both are possible. 

29. The case for a slower than usual regression rests on my belief that most of the reasons 
suggested  for  a  lowering  of  rates  are  slow-moving:  population  profiles;  Fed  policy 
regimes; temporary (or permanent) lack of a growth push from innovation; income 
inequality. Much as I would like some of these factors, such as income inequality, to 
change rapidly, it seems wishful thinking. What do you think?  It took 35 years to get 
from high to low in rates, for example. Bottom line, I suggest a 20-year flight path to 
get back two-thirds of the way to normal so that T-bills will yield around 1.2-1.5% real 
again, and developed country equities will return 5.0% instead of our current 5.7% 
“normal” assumption. Let me point out that all alternate assumptions – whether three 
years, seven years, or no return at all – are also arbitrary. Granted, each of these is 
merely a possibility. Our task is to find the least unlikely.

30. And now for another difficult and contentious point: Over roughly the last 20 years 
there  has  been  a  historically  unprecedented  rise  in  corporate  profit  margins.  The 
reasons for this will be considered in part two next quarter. Importantly, many of the 
reasons are structural and very slow-moving. There is little in the real world data to 
suggest that there will be a rapid decline back to the old average. 

31. In the model I am suggesting here, I assume that corporate returns will slowly, over 20 

years, drop back two-thirds of the way to their old normal.

32. This  is  how  my  suggested  20-year  “evolution”  would  play  out  compared  to  our 

traditional 7-year full mean reversion model (see Exhibit 8).

33. The 20-year approximate returns likely from “the whimper” flight path from EAFE 
and emerging equities are shown in Exhibits 9 and 10. In summary, we expect returns 
of 2.8% a year from US equities, 4% from EAFE, and 5.3% from emerging market 
equities. (This last number does suggest the only, kamikaze, way to achieve a 5% target 
return. Anyone for some career risk?)

34. It turns out that all three mean-reverting flight paths end up with remarkably similar 
and painful outcomes for pension funds and others at a 20-year horizon: 2.4% a year 
for the standard 7-year slump and 13 years of full returns; 2.6% for a 2-year crash and 
18 years of full returns; and 2.8% a year for my 20-year whimper. This narrow range is 
a significant and perhaps unexpected outcome: Any set of assumptions that includes 
even a modest reduction in current abnormally high corporate profits and hence some 
reduction in growth – to be offset by a required increase in yield with a corresponding 
loss of capital – results in a very disappointing 20-year flight path. 

35. Normal bear markets of 15 to 25% can, of course, always occur. They have nothing to 
do with this analysis though, which is trying to come to grips with a slow-burning shift 
in the long-term equilibrium. Old-fashioned bubbles breaking causes major declines 
back to the previously existing equilibriums. A normal bear market is, in comparison, 
short-term noise. (Although I grant you that at the lows everyone starts to look for 
arguments justifying even further and more permanent declines. Investing is tough!) 
Global and domestic political shocks often cause a modest decline. History shows 
that these are nearly always short-lived and the initial response is almost invariably 
exaggerated. Domestic economic shocks are the meat and potatoes of market noise as 
markets over-respond to provisional data that after three changes often ends up with 
a different sign. 

36. The current outlook includes the possibility of a Trump election. This would be an 
outlier event of its kind because it comes with possibilities of tariff wars and general 
political unease globally. With the constraints of Congress, however, it would seem 
unlikely to cause long-lived effects, although this is not impossible. Brexit problems 
have already caused problems that could easily worsen, as indicated by the weak pound.

GMO Quarterly Letter: 3Q 2016 

I believe that the biggest risk is that an extended economic recovery, which I actually 
expect, lasting for two more years, might start to finally push up wages enough to 
count. Should oil prices simultaneously bounce back, which I also expect (up to $100 a  
barrel by 2020), we could have an uptick in inflation, which has a very reliable history 
of lowering P/Es. All things considered, though, I would say this is market business as 
usual and not enough to interfere with my suggested 20-year forecast. 

37. Consequences for GMO. Like almost all investors, GMO has been effectively bullied 
by the 20-year Fed Regime. In our Benchmark-Free portfolio, we carry almost 50% of 
equity or equity-like exposure. If we had been looking at the current data 20 years ago, we 
would have carried less. Now, we recognize some possibility of the current low-return 
world continuing forever alongside a substantially larger possibility of our standard 
7-year outcome. The possibility of short-term bubbles breaking, which I consider so 
unlikely, is expressly ignored by our 7-year forecast, so there is no disagreement there. 
If GMO accepted my current thought experiment of a 20-year whimper as a certainty, 
what would the consequences be for a benchmark-free portfolio?  Perhaps 5-7% more 
equity exposure. A 60-65% equity position is considered to be what we would hold 
in a “normal” world with everything priced “fairly,” and, because my whimper flight 
path is not as attractive as that, we would be under 60% equity. But the gap between 
the risk-free rate and my whimper forecast for equities, when tilted to emerging and 
EAFE, is not that far away from normal. 
(A shorthand way of viewing this 5-7% more equity exposure is that with a lower 
chance of a near-term crash or a 7-year slump, the option value of cash would decrease 
and hence risky assets, including stocks, would become more attractive.)

 

  Over  our  28  years  of  asset  allocation,  most  of  our  risk  reduction  for  clients  was 
concentrated in the two classic US bubbles of 2000 and 2007, which we sidestepped to 
a considerable degree.  Most of our extra performance, however, came from ranking 
the different asset classes more correctly than not. We still expect to be able to do this, 
even in this difficult and novel environment, and are facing an interesting, wide range 
of potential returns in different global equities and other assets as we write. 

  GMO does not expect its strategists or any of its analysts to toe a party line. James 
Montier, for example, four times the highest-rated strategist in Europe,2 is more bearish 
than our 7-year model. My current analysis is less bearish. Ben Inker, the portfolio 
manager, is informed by both of us and many others. He weights the alternatives as he 
sees fit and makes the final decision. It seems a good system, to me.

GMO Quarterly Letter: 3Q 2016Brexit: wounds from playing cricket
Yes, London, your financial business will be hurt. Long and hard. And most corporations will lose 
easy access to the biggest market in the world. As for universities, which receive much EU money, for 
students and faculty it will be a bone cruncher. Someone, somewhere may benefit?  But the people 
voted. In a sea of misrepresentations by a Brexit leadership who promptly resigned, 51.8% voted to 
leave. The people voted…in a way that has absolutely no constitutional standing. In contrast, Members 
of Parliament have an unstated constitutional and ethical duty to do what is in the best long-run 
interest of the UK. The majority of Members of Parliament know that Brexit is not that. But the people 
voted; so it would not be cricket (“not kosher” for Americans), to override it. But what a high price 
for playing cricket!
Happily, my one-third chance of no Brexit still looks good as the Prime Minister does her duty in 
frightening everyone with a cold and hard Brexit. Just possibly she is combining this hard-Brexit-up-
your-nose strategy with a remarkably inclusive program (for a Conservative!) to win over enough 
previously  Brexit  voters  to  have  a  revote  by  referendum  or  Parliament  by  the  spring  without  a 
revolution. You never know your luck.

What are Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs)? 
 
Crop varieties which have been developed using genetic engineering techniques are 
commonly known as GMOs (genetically modified organisms). Genetic engineering 
allows the transfer of one specific gene or a set of genes within a plant family or across 
genetic lines. The overall goal of genetic engineering is to add a gene that will express a 
desirable trait in the plant such as resistance to a herbicide or resistance to pests. 
Genetic engineering techniques involve extracting and isolating a specific DNA segment 
that makes up a gene and inserting it into plant cells. Whole plants are grown from the 
successfully transformed cells using tissue culture, and then using traditional plant 
breeding the new gene is transferred into the crop population. 
 
Currently there are nine (9) crops that have GMO varieties available. These include: 
Corn (field and sweet corn), soybeans, canola, papaya, cotton, alfalfa, sugar beets, 
squash and rice. Soybean, canola, sugar beet, alfalfa, and corn GMO varieties have 
been modified for resistance to Roundup (Roundup Ready) and in some cases, Rely 
(Liberty Link); field corn, sweet corn and cotton varieties have been modified to contain 
and express one or more B.t. (Bacillus thuringiensis) genes to make them resistant to 
some insect pests; papaya and squash have been modified to be resistant to insect 
vectored viruses (ring spot virus in papaya and squash mosaic virus). Scientists have 
also developed a genetically modified rice variety (Golden Rice) that is high in vitamin 
A. 
 
Crops that are genetically modified are food and feed crops. The only crops that are 
likely to be in a greenhouse would be squash or sweet corn transplants being grown for 
setting out in a field.  Those plants cannot be sold to homeowners. Farmers must sign a 
technology agreement with the seed producer much like an agreement when buying 
software.  Only those growers signing the agreement can grow the crops, so sale to 
other growers or homeowners is not allowed. There are currently no flowers or 
ornamental GMO crops on the market. Some greenhouse growers are posting signs on 
their operations to assure customers that there no GMOs in their product line. 
 
In addition, seeds packaged for home garden use are not and cannot be genetically 
modified.  In saying this, there is a bit of confusion in that one home garden seed 
supplier has told customers that all seeds are genetically modified (GMO) but not all 
seeds are modified using genetic engineering. Although this is true, the term GMO is 
commonly used to refer to seeds that have been modified using genetic engineering. 
Also, all commercial (farmer) seed packages are clearly marked if they contain 
genetically modified seeds.   
 
Attitudes about GMOs vary widely both in the US and around the world. Many 
commodity crop farmers in the US have adopted GMOs as a way to grow better crops 
with fewer pesticides. Many consumers are concerned about GMOs due to the fear 
about potential health risks and fear of potential environmental risks. Many scientists 
support GMOs because of many years of studies showing little or no health and 

ecological risks, and the potential for developing higher yielding crops to feed the rapidly 
increasing world population.  
 
In the United States GMOs are regulated by the US Department of Agriculture (USDA), 
The Environmental  Protection Agency (EPA) and the Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA). The USDA ensures the health and safety of the GMOs to plant and animal 
health. Developers of GMO Crops must apply for a permit that requires them to address 
the potential risks of the GMO to plant and animal health and the possibility of the 
organism spreading into the environment.  The EPA regulates only the genetic material 
incorporated into the plant not the plant itself. It regulates any GMO that contains a 
pesticide (e.g. B.t.) as part of the genetic makeup and requires developers to address 
the short term and long term consequences of the pesticide on humans, livestock and 
the environment 
 
The FDA regulates the safety of the GMOs consumed by people or animals. The FDA 
requires that the GMOs be substantially equivalent to non GMOs and therefore 
classifies them as safe. Under the FDA policy GMOs do not require approval from FDA 
before they are marketed. However the GMO developers are given voluntary option to 
consult with the FDA to discuss nutritional or safety issues. 
 
The FDA does not require the labelling of GMOs unless a food contains an allergen, a 
known toxicant that exceeds tolerable limits, or has nutritional properties that have been 
significantly altered. Currently the only food label that ensures absence of GMO is the 
USDA Certified Organic label. GMOs are prohibited in organic production and in organic 
products.  In addition, organizations such as “The Non-GMO Project 
(www.nongmoproject.org)”  list foods that do not contain GMO’s on their web site.

Genetically modified organisms

Breeding agricultural plants 
Plant breeders have traditionally crossed plants that exhibit wanted properties and selected 
among the offspring those that had acquired the wanted properties, but this can only be done 
when the cross produces fertile offspring. With recombinant DNA technology, it is possible to 
cut a small piece of DNA from one species (donor), introduce it into the DNA of another 
species (host) with which it cannot cross, but in which the donor DNA is expressed. The host 
species, now called a genetically modified organism (GMO), thus acquires a new property it 
could not have obtained by conventional breeding (Nature 2002).  

The first GMO was constructed in 1972; 10 years later a genetically modified plant was 
produced and by 1996, 2.8 million hectares of commercial crops were grown. By 2004, 8 
million farmers in 17 countries grew 81 million hectares of modified soya bean, cotton, 
canola and maize (James 2004). Genes that confer herbicide resistance and insect tolerance 
are the most widely used genes commercially (Akhurst et al 2002 and Maclean et al 1997). 

 
Surveillance of the technology 
The Australian government assumed responsibility for the regulation of gene technology in 
1981 and established a non-statutory authority, the Recombinant DNA Monitoring Committee 
(RDMC), later replaced by the Genetic Manipulation Advisory Committee (GMAC). In 2000, 
with the passing of the Gene Technology Act 2000, the Office of the Gene Technology 
Regulator (OGTR) was established, with responsibility for regulating research, field trials and 
commercial production of genetically modified organisms (Senate Community Affairs 
References Committee 2000).  

Prior to any dealing with a genetically modified organism, a licence must be obtained from 
the OGTR. Applicants for a licence must provide detailed information about the host, the 
donor, the transferred DNA, how the DNA is transferred, the properties of the resulting 

GMO, especially its fitness and fertility and where the GMO will be grown. The OGTR then 
conducts a formal risk assessment, in consultation with relevant state, territory and Australian 
government agencies and the general public. Following this process, the OGTR makes a 
decision on whether to grant a licence.  

The Gene Technology Act also provides for the designation of areas by a state for the purpose 
of preserving the identity of genetically modified or non- genetically modified crops for 
marketing purposes. Such designation can have the effect of imposing a moratorium on the 
commercial cultivation of genetically modified crops, even when a licence has been granted 
by OGTR.  

Victoria, New South Wales, South Australia, Western Australia, Tasmania and the Australian 
Capital Territory have each passed special moratorium legislation to control commercial 
production of genetically modified crops. Western Australia has a moratorium on the 
cultivation of all genetically modified (GM) crops until December 2008. South Australia has 
a moratorium on all GM food crops and has extended its moratorium on canola from 2006 to 
2008. Victoria has a moratorium on cultivation of GM canola until 2007 but allows GM 
carnations. New South Wales has a moratorium on the commercial cultivation of all GM food 
crops until March 2008. Tasmania has a moratorium on the commercial cultivation of GM 
crops until November 2009, initially via quarantine legislation, and now through special 
moratorium legislation. The Australian Capital Territory has a moratorium on the cultivation 
of GM canola and other GM food crops until June 2006. Under these arrangements, however, 
the states and territories allow the conduct of OGTR approved experimental trials of GM 
crops.  

Genetically modified cotton (herbicide resistant and insect tolerant) and genetically modified 
carnations (colour modified) are the only commercial GM plants grown in Australia at this 
time (Bt cotton 80,000 ha; carnations <10ha) (see note for description of Bt cotton). A wide 
variety of broad acre crop and horticultural plants have been grown in small field trials in all 
states of Australia. 
Concerns with genetically modified organisms  
The risk assessment and management process carried out under the legislation looks at a 
range of issues that may present risks to human health or the environment. After scientific 
evaluation a judgement is made as to whether the risk can be eliminated, minimised or 
managed to an acceptable level.  

Examples of these issues include potential for: 

•  pollen from the GMO may carry to a non-GMO crop,  thus introducing the novel 

gene into a conventional crop (Rieger et al 1999),  

•  pollen from a herbicide resistant GMO may cross with a compatible weed and 

introduce resistance in the weed (Rieger et al 1999), 

•  herbicide resistant crop plants may emerge in a following season and be difficult to 

control, 

• 

insects might develop resistance to insecticides made in GMO plants (e.g. Bt cotton), 

•  harm might result to soil biota, thus harming nutrient cycling, 

• 

• 

the GMO might have a poor nutritional profile or be poorly digested and 

the GMO might make a toxin, allergen or teratogen. 

Data on these potential hazards, the probability of them occurring and the ability to control 
them, are required by the Office of the Gene Technology Regulator (OGTR) prior to a risk 
analysis for genetically modified plants grown in contained glasshouses and in small field 
trials, before larger-scale trials and commercial production would be permitted. Before open 
trials begin, the GMOs can be analysed and tested for the presence of harmful components, 
lack of essential nutrients, digestibility and pollen travel. 

The risk of pollen spread and outcrossing to weeds varies considerably. Some plants are self 
pollinating and low risk, whereas others outcross routinely within species and close relatives, 
and sparingly with distantly related weeds (e.g. canola). Trees such as eucalypts hybridise 
readily over long distances (e.g. kilometres) and flower, as a forest, over many months 
(Ashton 2003). Outcrossing here could be controlled by ensuring that the pollen of the GMO 
is sterile. 

With outcrossing genetically modified organisms, the OGTR can set buffer zones free of the 
GMO to control the spread of pollen. 

There has also been concern in the community about genetically modified organisms from the 
point of view of the religious or moral implications of such technology, or a preference for a 
particular life style or food (‘organic food’), or concern about market power that may result 
from particular seed product licensing arrangements. These factors are not taken into 
consideration under the current regulatory process, which focuses on risks to human health 
and the environment.  
Benefits from genetically GMO crops 
GMO crops can confer social and environmental benefits: 

•  herbicide resistant crops need less tillage, which enhances the content of organic 
matter in the soil, reduces erosion by wind and water and improves soil structure. 
Less herbicide is used resulting in less runoff to watercourses. 

•  plants producing toxins selective against caterpillar larvae reduce the number of 

sprays of persistent chemicals by up to 60%. This spares useful insects and reduces 
the pollution of soil and waterways with chemicals. 

•  GMO crops can be made that produce vitamins lacking in some staple crops e.g. 

genes for vitamin A production introduced into rice (MacLean et al 1997). 

• 

research is in progress to increase salt or drought tolerance – an important 
consideration as the world population rises and, currently, arable land is at a 
premium. 

Gene technology exploits our knowledge of the universal nature of the genetic code; it 
enables plant breeders to develop useful cultivars that are unattainable by conventional 
practices. Some sectors hold concerns as to the safety of genetically modified organisms, but 
with careful, scientific scrutiny, the management of putative risks becomes possible. 
 
Note: 
Bt or Ingard cottons have been grown commercially in Australia since 1996. They produce an 
insecticidal protein from the naturally-occurring bacterium, Bacillus thuringiensis, and were 
developed to help in the control of the main insect pests of cotton — Helicoverpa armigera 
and H. punctigera.

What is a Genetically Modified 
Organism? 

•A genetically modified organism (GMO), also known as a transgenic organism, is any organism 
whose genetic material has been altered using genetic engineering techniques. (Wikipedia) 

•An organism or microorganism  whose genetic material has been altered by means of genetic 
engineering. (Dictionary.com) 

•A genetically modified organism (GMO) is any organism the genetics of which have been altered 
through the use of modern biotechnology to create a novel combination of genetic material. 
(Monsanto Dictionary) 

•Organisms whose genetic material has been artificially manipulated in a laboratory through 
genetic engineering, or GE. This relatively new science creates unstable combinations of plant, 
animal, bacteria and viral genes that do not occur in nature or through traditional crossbreeding 
methods. (NONGMO Project)

Concerns?

Overall, risk to the environment or human health 
Hybridize with non-GM plants through pollen (canola) 

Pests will become resistant (refuge in a bag) 

Conditions required to grow GM crops will interfere with wildlife habitat 
(biodiversity) 

Adverse effects on human health 

Carcinogen, toxic, allergens

Hybridize with non-GM plants through 
pollen- Canola (B. napus)
Pollenmediated, intraspecies gene flow from canola to its wild relatives.
 B. rapa L. (rapeseed), Raphanus raphanistrum L. (wild radish), Sinapis

arvensis L. (wild mustard), and Erucastrum gallicum (common dogmustard)  

B. napus       B. rapa = (cid:5)ý7% in commercial fields and (cid:5)ý13.6% in the wild
GE B. napus 

three wild varieties was shown to be low (<2 to 5 x 10(cid:4)>(cid:3)ñ)

Genes could move via wild volunteers

Most outcrossing occurred in the first ten meters from the field

Rate of outcrossing was influenced by factors relating to the field, plant, 
pollen, and environment influenced the rate

Pests will become resistant
Refuge in a bag 
Mandatory refuge requirements(cid:3)v
planting sufficient acres of the non-Bt
crop near the Bt crop(cid:3)vwere needed 
to reduce the rate at which targeted 
insect pests evolved resistance

Such refuges slow the rate at which 
Bt resistance evolves by allowing 
target insects that are susceptible to 
the Bt toxin to survive and reproduce

Conditions required to grow GM crops 
will interfere with wildlife habitat

A lot of bird species returned to cotton fields as 
soon as GM cotton replaced conventional 
insecticides.
 Before GM cotton, birds were eating insecticide-
laden insects and dying as a result.

Safe or no? 

A project to develop genetically modified peas by adding a protein 
from beans that conferred resistance to weevils was abandoned 
after it was shown that the GM peas caused a lung allergy in mice. 

Safety testing of GM plants 

is effective by having 
identified allergenic 
potential before the 

product was released on 

the market. 

All GM is unpredictable 
and if this caused allergic 
reaction then all GMOs 
probably due. The 
process is unpredictable 
and dangerous.

Genetically Modified Organisms 

By Ashley Bowers 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Genetically modified organisms (GMOs) are altered by artificial means through the 

reconstruction of their DNA. GMOs have gained popularity in the food industry because they 

possess desirable traits; certain GMO crops resist pesticides and yield a higher productivity of 

food as with the production of more dairy products to be produced from animals. However, the 

negative effects of both outweigh the positives, particularly in considering people’s health today 

and tomorrow. Genetically modified organisms and hormonally modified livestock are currently 

not required to be labeled when sold in grocery stores. Thus, consumers may not know whether 

they are buying foods that have been genetically altered with chemicals and other such additives. 

These additives are now gaining negative publicity in that they are bad for one’s health and 

body. Requiring the government to label genetically modified foods provides important 

information for the consumer; therefore, consumers benefit and America will join other countries 

in labeling GMOs.    

American consumers are currently unaware which foods they buy in a grocery store are 

genetically modified. This obliviousness is brought on by the lobbyists for the Food and Drug 

Administration (FDA), and the companies who produce the genetically modified foods 

themselves. There is one company that is the world leader in agrochemistry and genetically 

modified organisms and that company is Monsanto. Marie-Monique Robin, who is an award-

winning French journalist, states in her book The World According to Monsanto, that Monsanto 

was “founded in St. Louis, Missouri, in 1901, which now owns 90 percent of patents for all 

GMOs grown in the world and became the world’s largest seed company in 2005”  (Robin 2). 

Because of its dominance in the agri-business industry, Monsanto is a part of a lot of 

controversies regarding genetically modified organisms. The company makes toxic products as 

well as the herbicide Roundup, which, when it claimed it was “biodegradable” and “good for the 

environment,” later got the company in trouble for false advertising for making such claims 

(Robin).  

Monsanto has questionable marketing schemes, as they strongly try to influence the 

general public that they are a company focused on the people’s best’s interests and that its 

products help farmers. Monsanto has crops all over the world with its genetically modified 

organisms and continues to claim that it is a company that has a focus on environmental 

sustainability and the good of humanity (Robin 4). Robin looked on Monsanto’s website and 

wrote in her book that the company: 

presents itself as ‘an agricultural company’ whose purpose is to help farmers 

around the world produce healthier food, while also reducing agriculture’s impact 

on our environment.’ But what it did not say is that before getting involved in 

agriculture, it was one of the largest chemical companies of the twentieth century, 

specializing particularly in plastics, polystyrenes, and other synthetic fibers. 

(Robin 3) 

Monsanto’s website is specifically geared toward showing only positive points of the 

company, and it seems like a company that is actually doing a lot of good for the agricultural 

industry. This false advertising is misleading to onlookers and it is only this positive side of its 

company that Monsanto wants people to see and know about.  

Further in her book, Robin states that during her long-term investigation of the company, 

she contacted someone who the St. Louis headquarters sent her to, “Yann Fichet, an agronomist 

who is the director of institutional and industrial affairs of the French subsidiary located in 

Lyon” (Robin). Fichet agreed to meet with Robin and sent her request to meet with the Missouri 

headquarters. As Robin recalls, she waited three months to hear of a rejection about the 

interview. The rejection of the Missouri headquarters of Monsanto to interview with Robin could 

have signaled that they feared her asking a question that they would have to lie to provide an 

answer to. Based on the external sources of their website and advertising, it appears that 

Monsanto strives to produce a favorable appearance that will provide benefits for the future of 

humanity and agriculture. 

As one investigates further into Monsanto, however, their questionable profit margin 

becomes increasingly apparent. According to the company’s own website, in 2012 Monsanto’s 

net sales were 13,504 million dollars (“Financial Highlights” Monsanto). Monsanto makes a lot 

of money and the company could potentially benefit even more so by using the money in more 

of a positive way. Monsanto could turn around their tactics and become a company that actually 

stays true to their word.  

Once farm soil has been destroyed with the Roundup chemical Monsanto produces, it 

becomes dependent on it. Therefore, farmers whose crops have been infected with it cannot go 

back to regular farming. Monsanto traps consumers into its cycle, for the company’s “actions are 

designed to maximize its corporate profits, not to serve the people. Its entire seed-and-herbicide 

business model is designed to trap farmers in a system of economic dependence... to turn farmers 

into indentured servants” (Adams). Making sure they patent everything they produce, “when 

Monsanto’s GMO seeds blow into the fields of farmers who are trying to avoid growing GMOs, 

Monsanto uses its patent ‘rights’ to sue the farmers and claim they “stole” Monsanto property” 

(Adams).  

Monsanto not only is a ringleader in producing these factory farms that hold genetically 

modified foods, but they are taking over independent farmer’s farms at an increasing rate, 

causing the farmers and their families to lose a majority of what they have. In August 1998, a 

Canadian canola farmer named Percy Schmeiser was taken to court by Monsanto, in which 

Monsanto claimed “he illegally planted the firm’s canola without paying a $37-per-hectare fee 

for the privilege” (“The Conflict”). However, unlike other farmers who Monsanto has taken to 

court, Schmeiser spoke out and fought back stating that “that company seed could easily have 

blown on to his soil from passing canola-laden trucks” (“The Conflict”). During the three week 

court hearing: 

Monsanto presented evidence from two dozen witnesses and samplers that 

Schmeiser's eight fields all were more than 90% Roundup Ready, indicating it 

was a commercial-grade crop. Monsanto performed no independent tests as their 

tests were all performed in house or by experts hired by the company. (“The 

Conflict”)  

Although Schmeiser received a few monetary donations here and there to help him pay 

the $400,000 Monsanto requested for patent infringement, court fees, profits they feel Schmeiser 

made on the crop, and more, the bottom line is that large companies such as Monsanto use their 

power to their advantage, victimizing small-town farmers along the way.  

Not only does Monsanto create genetically modified foods through their genetically 

engineered seeds (Roundup seeds), they inject cows with bovine growth hormones. Bovine 

growth hormones, rBGH, are hormonally modified livestock that result when an animal is 

injected with artificial growth hormones. This is a way farmers try to yield a larger production of 

products. An example of this is milk from cows. Genetically engineered hormone injections are 

not healthy, not only to the animal, but to the consumers of the animal’s products as well. Bovine 

growth hormones were “discovered to create severe inflammation in the cow’s udder called 

mastitis which leads to large amounts of infected pus in the milk” (Quigley 27). However, people 

realized this problem and to balance it out, they started feeding cows a larger-than-normal 

number of antibiotics, which is found in the drinking milk produced. Monsanto uses rBGH in 

their cows and when this was brought to the attention of one FDA worker, the worker was fired 

for challenging Monsanto’s scientists’ a second time for presenting improper data about the cows 

they injected (Robin 93). The FDA was on Monsanto’s side, to “protect the company’s interests” 

so therefore it “closed its eyes to the disturbing data” (Robin 93). All the while, the FDA worker, 

who shares his experience in Robin’s book, recalled that “during the appeal, Monsanto’s lawyers 

threatened to go after me if I revealed confidential information about rBGH” (Robin 93). 

Monsanto claims to have the people’s best interests at heart, although, Monsanto does the same 

thing with crops as it does with cattle, by not revealing the negative side effects.  

In stores across America, labels of whether certain foods are genetically modified or not 

are currently not required. Average consumers are potentially unaware of which foods are 

genetically modified or not. It is currently a national policy in America for organic foods to go 

through the United States Department of Agriculture’s National Organic Program and the 

Organic Foods Production Act in order for certification to be sold in stores as organic foods. If 

the same type of act were to be applied to GMOs, the consumer would be able to make a 

decision on whether or not they wish to buy the products.   

One of the current problems with genetically modified foods is that most people do not 

know the health risks, ecological risks, harms, and impacts that are associated with them. This 

ignorance regarding genetically modified organisms of the general public translates into a 

problem of consumers not knowing what they are ingesting into their bodies. A comparison can 

be made between GMOs and the organochlorine insecticide chemical DDT, 

dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane, that was used up until the mid-20th century and grew 

increasingly popular until 1962, when a book written by American aquatic biologist Rachel 

Carson, Silent Spring, was published. Silent Spring explained its dangers and brought to light the 

fact that it was being used in vast amounts with little knowledge of its effects on the environment 

and people. This is similar to today, where genetically modified organisms are currently mostly 

thought of as good to the general public, because common thought is that they help an increasing 

population due to their ability to yield mass amounts of food. However, what the public does not 

see, is the dangers and negative side of genetically modified organisms and why they should be 

labeled. In Rachel Carson’s Silent Spring, she states: 

I contend, furthermore, that we have allowed these chemicals to be used with little 

or no advance investigation of their effect on soil, water, wildlife, and man 

himself. […] There is still very limited awareness of the nature of the threat. This 

is an era of specialists, each of whom sees his own problem and is unaware of or 

intolerant of the larger frame into which it fits. It is also an era dominated by 

industry, in which the right to make a dollar at whatever cost is seldom 

challenged. […] We urgently need an end to these false assurances, to the sugar 

coating of unpalatable facts. (Carson 13) 

In current times, Monsanto is the largest seed company in the world, it is also the 

company that is providing these false assurances about GMOs to the public. Through the closed 

doors of the governmental agencies, GMOs effects on the environment go unnoticed.  

Some of the ecological risks associated with genetically modified foods are the threat to 

genetic diversity of crops, small populations potentially becoming extinct, and the injection of 

new viral strains of recombinant DNA into genetically modified foods. The United States holds 

diversity for “berries, sunflower, Jerusalem artichoke, pecan, black walnut, and muscadine 

grape” (Rissler and Mellon 57). Variations in these species are declining rapidly, due to 

destruction of land and as crops are abandoned by farmers for various reasons. This allows for 

genetically modified crops to take over as they could potentially “confer tolerance to cold, heat, 

drought, or salt” better than the crops and plants originally grown in that area (Rissler and Melon 

56). As for viral strains of recombinant DNA being injected in the genetically modified 

organisms in attempt to ward off viruses arising in the plants, new viruses may emerge anyway. 

Study of the ecological impact of this recombination of GMOs is still new; however, “some 

scientists speculate whether that recombination may play a role in the evolution and survival of 

plant viruses or, under certain conditions, produce a new viral strain with an altered host range” 

(Rissler and Mellon 62). As the importance of GMOs increases, the public knowledge of GMOs 

should become more of a priority. 

Other countries speculate that certain diseases present in society are the cause of 

genetically modified organisms. In the 1990s, as Mad Cow Disease, or Bovine spongiform 

encephalopathy (BSE), began its spread through Europe, “Germany’s Green Party began 

attacking what it called ‘genetically modified organisms’ or ‘GMOs’” as a possible cause (Pence 

9). Greenpeace International argued consistently throughout the late 1990s that “although no 

evidence exists of dangers to digestion or environment from GMOs, it’s better to wait and see 

before allowing their growth” (Pence 9). This “better-safe-than-sorry” attitude is a cautious one 

towards GMOs and represents how Europe interprets the situation. As the amount of information 

on GMOs and their negative effects on not only the environment but humans as well is becoming 

increasingly available, America should recognize these effects and take them into consideration 

when debating policies on the labeling of genetically modified foods in the lawmaking realm of 

the country.  

As lawmakers are influenced by company spokespersons from the agri-business industry, 

lawmakers do not question when they are told that “GE food is identical to foods bred by 

selective (traditional) breeding; GE food is safe; GE food is associated with good environmental 

practices; and GE food will cure world hunger” (Nelson 217). The truth to these claims, 

however, lies in the science behind the statements. “Scientists note that conventional breeders 

rely on processes that occur in nature (such as sexual and asexual reproduction) to develop new 

plants” meaning that in conventional breeding of food, the process is often safer than the 

genetically engineered process of reproducing food. This is because with genetic engineering, the 

combination of genes is often unpredictable and therefore presents possible risks (Nelson 218). 

“In 1997, when farmers growing GE cotton reported that the plants had stunted growth, 

deformed root systems and produced malformed cotton balls” and the ability of genetic 

engineering to allow scientists to “transfer genes from completely unrelated life forms, creating 

such concoctions as corn that exudes toxins found in soil bacteria or tobacco that glows due to 

the insertion into its genome of a firefly gene,” explains this phenomena. Since the outcomes of 

genetic engineering and/or modification are so unpredictable, the waiting and seeing of results of 

the finished product is necessary in order for the safety of GMOs to be tested and accounted for 

in lawmaking. The impatience of the lawmakers combined with the lack of willingness to change 

policies that do not concern their best interests and relations with companies, is something that 

influences their decisions on whether GMOs should be required to be labeled or not.  

The result of genetic modification is something that is hard to predict given that 

organisms are produced by the combination of different genes chosen by the scientists that create 

them. This is in itself knowledge that is gained in the scientific methodical process by examining 

the results of the production/experiment. It is therefore necessary to take precautions when 

dealing with GMOs given the uncertainty of the outcomes of their genetic combinations. 

Because the outcomes are unpredictable and cannot always be known in advanced, the 

precautionary principle needs to be adhered to.  

Once the outcomes are known, this knowledge of GMOs, once gained, is rarely translated 

out of the scientific community and into the general public because “many regulatory systems 

use outside scientific advice experts on advisory committees to help assess a GM application. 

However, they only provide advice and do not make regulatory decisions themselves, as they are 

not accountable to the public” (Thomson 115). Although “these authorities should have a prime 

responsibility to protect public health and the environment” there is often more to the situations 

than that. There are possibilities of the agri-business industry sending out lobbyists to try and 

sway lawmakers to vote in their favor on propositions regarding genetically modified foods and 

money could potentially be involved in the deal as well, complicating the issue further. There 

needs to be justice within our judicial system as people are not provided with the labels of GMOs 

while shopping in stores. Therefore, they are not given that initial knowledge that should be 

provided prior to purchase and consumption of GMOs, given the associated problems and 

potential health risks of them.  

 

It is not only in the best interest of the citizens of America for genetically modified 

organisms to be required to be labeled, but it is in the best interest of the nation as a whole. The 

knowledge of the effects that GMOs have on the environment as well as animal and human 

health lie in the results of the experiments that genetic engineers perform to create GMOs. From 

analyzing these results, there seems to be a negative conception associated with genetically 

modified foods spanning from the scale of agri-business to the individual. Putting this scale into 

terms of the person, as Rachel Carson quoted experimental biologist Jean Rostand in Silent 

Spring, “’the obligation to endure gives us the right to know’” (13).

Breeding agricultural plants 
Plant breeders have traditionally crossed plants that exhibit wanted properties and selected 
among the offspring those that had acquired the wanted properties, but this can only be done 
when the cross produces fertile offspring. With recombinant DNA technology, it is possible to 
cut a small piece of DNA from one species (donor), introduce it into the DNA of another 
species (host) with which it cannot cross, but in which the donor DNA is expressed. The host 
species, now called a genetically modified organism (GMO), thus acquires a new property it 
could not have obtained by conventional breeding (Nature 2002).  

The first GMO was constructed in 1972; 10 years later a genetically modified plant was 
produced and by 1996, 2.8 million hectares of commercial crops were grown. By 2004, 8 
million farmers in 17 countries grew 81 million hectares of modified soya bean, cotton, 
canola and maize (James 2004). Genes that confer herbicide resistance and insect tolerance 
are the most widely used genes commercially (Akhurst et al 2002 and Maclean et al 1997). 

 
Surveillance of the technology 
The Australian government assumed responsibility for the regulation of gene technology in 
1981 and established a non-statutory authority, the Recombinant DNA Monitoring Committee 
(RDMC), later replaced by the Genetic Manipulation Advisory Committee (GMAC). In 2000, 
with the passing of the Gene Technology Act 2000, the Office of the Gene Technology 
Regulator (OGTR) was established, with responsibility for regulating research, field trials and 
commercial production of genetically modified organisms (Senate Community Affairs 
References Committee 2000).  

Prior to any dealing with a genetically modified organism, a licence must be obtained from 
the OGTR. Applicants for a licence must provide detailed information about the host, the 
donor, the transferred DNA, how the DNA is transferred, the properties of the resulting 

GMO, especially its fitness and fertility and where the GMO will be grown. The OGTR then 
conducts a formal risk assessment, in consultation with relevant state, territory and Australian 
government agencies and the general public. Following this process, the OGTR makes a 
decision on whether to grant a licence.  

The Gene Technology Act also provides for the designation of areas by a state for the purpose 
of preserving the identity of genetically modified or non- genetically modified crops for 
marketing purposes. Such designation can have the effect of imposing a moratorium on the 
commercial cultivation of genetically modified crops, even when a licence has been granted 
by OGTR.  

Victoria, New South Wales, South Australia, Western Australia, Tasmania and the Australian 
Capital Territory have each passed special moratorium legislation to control commercial 
production of genetically modified crops. Western Australia has a moratorium on the 
cultivation of all genetically modified (GM) crops until December 2008. South Australia has 
a moratorium on all GM food crops and has extended its moratorium on canola from 2006 to 
2008. Victoria has a moratorium on cultivation of GM canola until 2007 but allows GM 
carnations. New South Wales has a moratorium on the commercial cultivation of all GM food 
crops until March 2008. Tasmania has a moratorium on the commercial cultivation of GM 
crops until November 2009, initially via quarantine legislation, and now through special 
moratorium legislation. The Australian Capital Territory has a moratorium on the cultivation 
of GM canola and other GM food crops until June 2006. Under these arrangements, however, 
the states and territories allow the conduct of OGTR approved experimental trials of GM 
crops.  

Genetically modified cotton (herbicide resistant and insect tolerant) and genetically modified 
carnations (colour modified) are the only commercial GM plants grown in Australia at this 
time (Bt cotton 80,000 ha; carnations <10ha) (see note for description of Bt cotton). A wide 
variety of broad acre crop and horticultural plants have been grown in small field trials in all 
states of Australia. 
Concerns with genetically modified organisms  
The risk assessment and management process carried out under the legislation looks at a 
range of issues that may present risks to human health or the environment. After scientific 
evaluation a judgement is made as to whether the risk can be eliminated, minimised or 
managed to an acceptable level.  

Examples of these issues include potential for: 

•  pollen from the GMO may carry to a non-GMO crop,  thus introducing the novel 

gene into a conventional crop (Rieger et al 1999),  

•  pollen from a herbicide resistant GMO may cross with a compatible weed and 

introduce resistance in the weed (Rieger et al 1999), 

•  herbicide resistant crop plants may emerge in a following season and be difficult to 

control, 

• 

insects might develop resistance to insecticides made in GMO plants (e.g. Bt cotton), 

•  harm might result to soil biota, thus harming nutrient cycling, 

• 

• 

the GMO might have a poor nutritional profile or be poorly digested and 

the GMO might make a toxin, allergen or teratogen. 

Data on these potential hazards, the probability of them occurring and the ability to control 
them, are required by the Office of the Gene Technology Regulator (OGTR) prior to a risk 
analysis for genetically modified plants grown in contained glasshouses and in small field 
trials, before larger-scale trials and commercial production would be permitted. Before open 
trials begin, the GMOs can be analysed and tested for the presence of harmful components, 
lack of essential nutrients, digestibility and pollen travel. 

The risk of pollen spread and outcrossing to weeds varies considerably. Some plants are self 
pollinating and low risk, whereas others outcross routinely within species and close relatives, 
and sparingly with distantly related weeds (e.g. canola). Trees such as eucalypts hybridise 
readily over long distances (e.g. kilometres) and flower, as a forest, over many months 
(Ashton 2003). Outcrossing here could be controlled by ensuring that the pollen of the GMO 
is sterile. 

With outcrossing genetically modified organisms, the OGTR can set buffer zones free of the 
GMO to control the spread of pollen. 

There has also been concern in the community about genetically modified organisms from the 
point of view of the religious or moral implications of such technology, or a preference for a 
particular life style or food (‘organic food’), or concern about market power that may result 
from particular seed product licensing arrangements. These factors are not taken into 
consideration under the current regulatory process, which focuses on risks to human health 
and the environment.  
Benefits from genetically GMO crops 
GMO crops can confer social and environmental benefits: 

•  herbicide resistant crops need less tillage, which enhances the content of organic 
matter in the soil, reduces erosion by wind and water and improves soil structure. 
Less herbicide is used resulting in less runoff to watercourses. 

•  plants producing toxins selective against caterpillar larvae reduce the number of 

sprays of persistent chemicals by up to 60%. This spares useful insects and reduces 
the pollution of soil and waterways with chemicals. 

•  GMO crops can be made that produce vitamins lacking in some staple crops e.g. 

genes for vitamin A production introduced into rice (MacLean et al 1997). 

• 

research is in progress to increase salt or drought tolerance – an important 
consideration as the world population rises and, currently, arable land is at a 
premium. 

Gene technology exploits our knowledge of the universal nature of the genetic code; it 
enables plant breeders to develop useful cultivars that are unattainable by conventional 
practices. Some sectors hold concerns as to the safety of genetically modified organisms, but 
with careful, scientific scrutiny, the management of putative risks becomes possible. 
 
Note: 
Bt or Ingard cottons have been grown commercially in Australia since 1996. They produce an 
insecticidal protein from the naturally-occurring bacterium, Bacillus thuringiensis, and were 
developed to help in the control of the main insect pests of cotton — Helicoverpa armigera 
and H. punctigera.

•A genetically modified organism (GMO) is any organism the genetics of which have been altered 
through the use of modern biotechnology to create a novel combination of genetic material. 
(Monsanto Dictionary) 

•Organisms whose genetic material has been artificially manipulated in a laboratory through 
genetic engineering, or GE. This relatively new science creates unstable combinations of plant, 
animal, bacteria and viral genes that do not occur in nature or through traditional crossbreeding 
methods. (NONGMO Project)

A lot of bird species returned to cotton fields as 
soon as GM cotton replaced conventional

 Before GM cotton, birds were eating insecticide-
laden insects and dying as a result.

Safe or no? 

A project to develop genetically modified peas by adding a protein 
from beans that conferred resistance to weevils was abandoned 
after it was shown that the GM peas caused a lung allergy in mice. 

Safety testing of GM plants 

is effective by having 
identified allergenic 
potential before the 

product was released on 

the market. 

All GM is unpredictable 
and if this caused allergic 
reaction then all GMOs 
probably due. The

Genetically Modified Organisms 

By Ashley Bowers 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Genetically modified organisms (GMOs) are altered by artificial means through the 

reconstruction of their DNA. GMOs have gained popularity in the food industry because they 

possess desirable traits; certain GMO crops resist pesticides and yield a higher productivity of 

food as with the production of more dairy products to be produced from animals. However, the 

negative effects of both outweigh the positives, particularly in considering people’s health today 

and tomorrow. Genetically modified organisms and hormonally modified livestock are currently 

not required to be labeled when sold in grocery stores. Thus, consumers may not know whether 

they are buying foods that have been genetically altered with chemicals and other such additives. 

These additives are now gaining negative publicity in that they are bad for one’s health and 

body. Requiring the government to label genetically modified foods provides important 

information for the consumer; therefore, consumers benefit and America will join other countries 

in labeling GMOs.    

American consumers are currently unaware which foods they buy in a grocery store are 

genetically modified. This obliviousness is brought on by the lobbyists for the Food and Drug 

Administration (FDA), and the companies who produce the genetically modified foods 

themselves. There is one company that is the world leader in agrochemistry and genetically 

modified organisms and that company is Monsanto. Marie-Monique Robin, who is an award-

winning French journalist, states in her book The World According to Monsanto, that Monsanto 

was “founded in St. Louis, Missouri, in 1901, which now owns 90 percent of patents for all 

GMOs grown in the world and became the world’s largest seed company in 2005”  (Robin 2). 

Because of its dominance in the agri-business industry, Monsanto is a part of a lot of 

controversies regarding genetically modified organisms. The company makes toxic products as 

well as the herbicide Roundup, which, when it claimed it was “biodegradable” and “good for the 

environment,” later got the company in trouble for false advertising for making such claims 

(Robin).  

Monsanto has questionable marketing schemes, as they strongly try to influence the 

general public that they are a company focused on the people’s best’s interests and that its 

products help farmers. Monsanto has crops all over the world with its genetically modified 

organisms and continues to claim that it is a company that has a focus on environmental 

sustainability and the good of humanity (Robin 4). Robin looked on Monsanto’s website and 

wrote in her book that the company: 

presents itself as ‘an agricultural company’ whose purpose is to help farmers 

around the world produce healthier food, while also reducing agriculture’s impact 

on our environment.’ But what it did not say is that before getting involved in 

agriculture, it was one of the largest chemical companies of the twentieth century, 

specializing particularly in plastics, polystyrenes, and other synthetic fibers. 

(Robin 3) 

Monsanto’s website is specifically geared toward showing only positive points of the 

company, and it seems like a company that is actually doing a lot of good for the agricultural 

industry. This false advertising is misleading to onlookers and it is only this positive side of its 

company that Monsanto wants people to see and know about.  

Further in her book, Robin states that during her long-term investigation of the company, 

she contacted someone who the St. Louis headquarters sent her to, “Yann Fichet, an agronomist 

who is the director of institutional and industrial affairs of the French subsidiary located in 

Lyon” (Robin). Fichet agreed to meet with Robin and sent her request to meet with the Missouri 

headquarters. As Robin recalls, she waited three months to hear of a rejection about the 

interview. The rejection of the Missouri headquarters of Monsanto to interview with Robin could 

have signaled that they feared her asking a question that they would have to lie to provide an 

answer to. Based on the external sources of their website and advertising, it appears that 

Monsanto strives to produce a favorable appearance that will provide benefits for the future of 

humanity and agriculture. 

As one investigates further into Monsanto, however, their questionable profit margin 

becomes increasingly apparent. According to the company’s own website, in 2012 Monsanto’s 

net sales were 13,504 million dollars (“Financial Highlights” Monsanto). Monsanto makes a lot 

of money and the company could potentially benefit even more so by using the money in more 

of a positive way. Monsanto could turn around their tactics and become a company that actually 

stays true to their word.  

Once farm soil has been destroyed with the Roundup chemical Monsanto produces, it 

becomes dependent on it. Therefore, farmers whose crops have been infected with it cannot go 

back to regular farming. Monsanto traps consumers into its cycle, for the company’s “actions are 

designed to maximize its corporate profits, not to serve the people. Its entire seed-and-herbicide 

business model is designed to trap farmers in a system of economic dependence... to turn farmers 

into indentured servants” (Adams). Making sure they patent everything they produce, “when 

Monsanto’s GMO seeds blow into the fields of farmers who are trying to avoid growing GMOs, 

Monsanto uses its patent ‘rights’ to sue the farmers and claim they “stole” Monsanto property” 

(Adams).  

Monsanto not only is a ringleader in producing these factory farms that hold genetically 

modified foods, but they are taking over independent farmer’s farms at an increasing rate, 

causing the farmers and their families to lose a majority of what they have. In August 1998, a 

Canadian canola farmer named Percy Schmeiser was taken to court by Monsanto, in which 

Monsanto claimed “he illegally planted the firm’s canola without paying a $37-per-hectare fee 

for the privilege” (“The Conflict”). However, unlike other farmers who Monsanto has taken to 

court, Schmeiser spoke out and fought back stating that “that company seed could easily have 

blown on to his soil from passing canola-laden trucks” (“The Conflict”). During the three week 

court hearing: 

Monsanto presented evidence from two dozen witnesses and samplers that 

Schmeiser's eight fields all were more than 90% Roundup Ready, indicating it 

was a commercial-grade crop. Monsanto performed no independent tests as their 

tests were all performed in house or by experts hired by the company. (“The 

Conflict”)  

Although Schmeiser received a few monetary donations here and there to help him pay 

the $400,000 Monsanto requested for patent infringement, court fees, profits they feel Schmeiser 

made on the crop, and more, the bottom line is that large companies such as Monsanto use their 

power to their advantage, victimizing small-town farmers along the way.  

Not only does Monsanto create genetically modified foods through their genetically 

engineered seeds (Roundup seeds), they inject cows with bovine growth hormones. Bovine 

growth hormones, rBGH, are hormonally modified livestock that result when an animal is 

injected with artificial growth hormones. This is a way farmers try to yield a larger production of 

products. An example of this is milk from cows. Genetically engineered hormone injections are 

not healthy, not only to the animal, but to the consumers of the animal’s products as well. Bovine 

growth hormones were “discovered to create severe inflammation in the cow’s udder called 

mastitis which leads to large amounts of infected pus in the milk” (Quigley 27). However, people 

realized this problem and to balance it out, they started feeding cows a larger-than-normal 

number of antibiotics, which is found in the drinking milk produced. Monsanto uses rBGH in 

their cows and when this was brought to the attention of one FDA worker, the worker was fired 

for challenging Monsanto’s scientists’ a second time for presenting improper data about the cows 

they injected (Robin 93). The FDA was on Monsanto’s side, to “protect the company’s interests” 

so therefore it “closed its eyes to the disturbing data” (Robin 93). All the while, the FDA worker, 

who shares his experience in Robin’s book, recalled that “during the appeal, Monsanto’s lawyers 

threatened to go after me if I revealed confidential information about rBGH” (Robin 93). 

Monsanto claims to have the people’s best interests at heart, although, Monsanto does the same 

thing with crops as it does with cattle, by not revealing the negative side effects.  

In stores across America, labels of whether certain foods are genetically modified or not 

are currently not required. Average consumers are potentially unaware of which foods are 

genetically modified or not. It is currently a national policy in America for organic foods to go 

through the United States Department of Agriculture’s National Organic Program and the 

Organic Foods Production Act in order for certification to be sold in stores as organic foods. If 

the same type of act were to be applied to GMOs, the consumer would be able to make a 

decision on whether or not they wish to buy the products.   

One of the current problems with genetically modified foods is that most people do not 

know the health risks, ecological risks, harms, and impacts that are associated with them. This 

ignorance regarding genetically modified organisms of the general public translates into a 

problem of consumers not knowing what they are ingesting into their bodies. A comparison can 

be made between GMOs and the organochlorine insecticide chemical DDT, 

dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane, that was used up until the mid-20th century and grew 

increasingly popular until 1962, when a book written by American aquatic biologist Rachel 

Carson, Silent Spring, was published. Silent Spring explained its dangers and brought to light the 

fact that it was being used in vast amounts with little knowledge of its effects on the environment 

and people. This is similar to today, where genetically modified organisms are currently mostly 

thought of as good to the general public, because common thought is that they help an increasing 

population due to their ability to yield mass amounts of food. However, what the public does not 

see, is the dangers and negative side of genetically modified organisms and why they should be 

labeled. In Rachel Carson’s Silent Spring, she states: 

I contend, furthermore, that we have allowed these chemicals to be used with little 

or no advance investigation of their effect on soil, water, wildlife, and man 

himself. […] There is still very limited awareness of the nature of the threat. This 

is an era of specialists, each of whom sees his own problem and is unaware of or 

intolerant of the larger frame into which it fits. It is also an era dominated by 

industry, in which the right to make a dollar at whatever cost is seldom 

challenged. […] We urgently need an end to these false assurances, to the sugar 

coating of unpalatable facts. (Carson 13) 

In current times, Monsanto is the largest seed company in the world, it is also the 

company that is providing these false assurances about GMOs to the public. Through the closed 

doors of the governmental agencies, GMOs effects on the environment go unnoticed.  

Some of the ecological risks associated with genetically modified foods are the threat to 

genetic diversity of crops, small populations potentially becoming extinct, and the injection of 

new viral strains of recombinant DNA into genetically modified foods. The United States holds 

diversity for “berries, sunflower, Jerusalem artichoke, pecan, black walnut, and muscadine 

grape” (Rissler and Mellon 57). Variations in these species are declining rapidly, due to 

destruction of land and as crops are abandoned by farmers for various reasons. This allows for 

genetically modified crops to take over as they could potentially “confer tolerance to cold, heat, 

drought, or salt” better than the crops and plants originally grown in that area (Rissler and Melon 

56). As for viral strains of recombinant DNA being injected in the genetically modified 

organisms in attempt to ward off viruses arising in the plants, new viruses may emerge anyway. 

Study of the ecological impact of this recombination of GMOs is still new; however, “some 

scientists speculate whether that recombination may play a role in the evolution and survival of 

plant viruses or, under certain conditions, produce a new viral strain with an altered host range” 

(Rissler and Mellon 62). As the importance of GMOs increases, the public knowledge of GMOs 

should become more of a priority. 

Other countries speculate that certain diseases present in society are the cause of 

genetically modified organisms. In the 1990s, as Mad Cow Disease, or Bovine spongiform 

encephalopathy (BSE), began its spread through Europe, “Germany’s Green Party began 

attacking what it called ‘genetically modified organisms’ or ‘GMOs’” as a possible cause (Pence 

9). Greenpeace International argued consistently throughout the late 1990s that “although no 

evidence exists of dangers to digestion or environment from GMOs, it’s better to wait and see 

before allowing their growth” (Pence 9). This “better-safe-than-sorry” attitude is a cautious one 

towards GMOs and represents how Europe interprets the situation. As the amount of information 

on GMOs and their negative effects on not only the environment but humans as well is becoming 

increasingly available, America should recognize these effects and take them into consideration 

when debating policies on the labeling of genetically modified foods in the lawmaking realm of 

the country.  

As lawmakers are influenced by company spokespersons from the agri-business industry, 

lawmakers do not question when they are told that “GE food is identical to foods bred by 

selective (traditional) breeding; GE food is safe; GE food is associated with good environmental 

practices; and GE food will cure world hunger” (Nelson 217). The truth to these claims, 

however, lies in the science behind the statements. “Scientists note that conventional breeders 

rely on processes that occur in nature (such as sexual and asexual reproduction) to develop new 

plants” meaning that in conventional breeding of food, the process is often safer than the 

genetically engineered process of reproducing food. This is because with genetic engineering, the 

combination of genes is often unpredictable and therefore presents possible risks (Nelson 218). 

“In 1997, when farmers growing GE cotton reported that the plants had stunted growth, 

deformed root systems and produced malformed cotton balls” and the ability of genetic 

engineering to allow scientists to “transfer genes from completely unrelated life forms, creating 

such concoctions as corn that exudes toxins found in soil bacteria or tobacco that glows due to 

the insertion into its genome of a firefly gene,” explains this phenomena. Since the outcomes of 

genetic engineering and/or modification are so unpredictable, the waiting and seeing of results of 

the finished product is necessary in order for the safety of GMOs to be tested and accounted for 

in lawmaking. The impatience of the lawmakers combined with the lack of willingness to change 

policies that do not concern their best interests and relations with companies, is something that 

influences their decisions on whether GMOs should be required to be labeled or not.  

The result of genetic modification is something that is hard to predict given that 

organisms are produced by the combination of different genes chosen by the scientists that create 

them. This is in itself knowledge that is gained in the scientific methodical process by examining 

the results of the production/experiment. It is therefore necessary to take precautions when 

dealing with GMOs given the uncertainty of the outcomes of their genetic combinations. 

Because the outcomes are unpredictable and cannot always be known in advanced, the 

precautionary principle needs to be adhered to.  

Once the outcomes are known, this knowledge of GMOs, once gained, is rarely translated 

out of the scientific community and into the general public because “many regulatory systems 

use outside scientific advice experts on advisory committees to help assess a GM application. 

However, they only provide advice and do not make regulatory decisions themselves, as they are 

not accountable to the public” (Thomson 115). Although “these authorities should have a prime 

responsibility to protect public health and the environment” there is often more to the situations 

than that. There are possibilities of the agri-business industry sending out lobbyists to try and 

sway lawmakers to vote in their favor on propositions regarding genetically modified foods and 

money could potentially be involved in the deal as well, complicating the issue further. There 

needs to be justice within our judicial system as people are not provided with the labels of GMOs 

while shopping in stores. Therefore, they are not given that initial knowledge that should be 

provided prior to purchase and consumption of GMOs, given the associated problems and 

potential health risks of them.  

 

It is not only in the best interest of the citizens of America for genetically modified 

organisms to be required to be labeled, but it is in the best interest of the nation as a whole. The 

knowledge of the effects that GMOs have on the environment as well as animal and human 

health lie in the results of the experiments that genetic engineers perform to create GMOs. From 

analyzing these results, there seems to be a negative conception associated with genetically 

modified foods spanning from the scale of agri-business to the individual. Putting this scale into 

terms of the person, as Rachel Carson quoted experimental biologist Jean Rostand in Silent 

Spring, “’the obligation to endure gives us the right to know’” (13).
