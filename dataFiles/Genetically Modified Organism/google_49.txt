GMO?
Genetically Modified Organism
A GMO IS:
the direct human manipulation of an organisms DNA in a laboratory environment.
A GMO IS NOT:
Plants and animals that are traditionally bred to achieve specific characteristics such as breeding dogs or cross-pollination of plants.
SCIENCE OF GMOS
Genetic modification may include the ADDITION OF DNA from species that would NOT BREED in nature.
Genetic modification may also involve REMOVING SPECIFIC STRANDS OF DNA.
Cross-species  or transgenic  genetic manipulation has gone so far as to COMBINE FISH DNA WITH STRAWBERRIES and tomatoes.

GMO foods have only existed in groceries since the late 1990s.
GMO life can be patented.
GMO varieties of corn and potatoes are engineered to PRODUCE THEIR OWN PESTICIDES.
PREVALENCE OF GMOS
Your probably eat GMOs EVERY DAY.
30,000
Different GMOs exist on grocery store shelves (largely because of how many processed foods contain soy.)
PERCENT OF GMOS IN TOTAL CROP PRODUCTION
2011 (USA)
Soybeans 94%
Cotton 90%
Corn 88%
STUDIES OF GMOS
NO LONG-TERM TESTING.
It took decades for the dangers of Trans-Fats (another artificial food) to become understood.
Mice fed GM pesticide-producing corn over four generations showed ABNORMAL structural and chemical changes to various organs and significantly reduced fertility.
Herbicide-resistant crops can cross-pollinate to create HERBICIDE-RESISTANT WEEDS.
Pesticide-producing GMO crops have led to RESISTANCE IN INSECTS.
TRANSGENIC DNA HAS BEEN FOUND IN 80% OF WILD CANOLA IN NORTH DAKOTA
PUBLIC OPINION OF GMOS
Polls consistently show that a significant majority of North Americans would LIKE TO BE ABLE TO TELL if the food theyre purchasing contains GMOs.
OUT OF A CBS NEW POLL:
87% want GMOs labeled
53% would not buy genetically modified food
NATIONAL OPINIONS OF GMOS:
The USA is the largest producer of GMO crops and does not mandate labels for GMO food.
In 30 other countries there are bans or restrictions on the production of GMOs because they are not considered proven safe.
