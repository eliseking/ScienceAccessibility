Development of melting temperature-based SYBR Green I polymerase chain reaction methods for multiplex genetically modified organism detectionMarta Hernndeza, David Rodrguez-Lzarob, Teresa Estevea, Salom Prata, Maria Plaa, b, , a Dpt. de Gentica Molecular, Institut de Biologia Molecular de Barcelona (IBMB), Centro de Investigacin y Desarrollo-Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientficas (CSIC), Jordi Girona 18-26, Barcelona 08034, Spainb Institute of Food and Agricultural Technology (INTEA), University of Girona, Girona, SpainReceived 12 May 2003, Available online 14 November 2003AbstractCommercialization of several genetically modified crops has been approved worldwide to date. Uniplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based methods to identify these different insertion events have been developed, but their use in the analysis of all commercially available genetically modified organisms (GMOs) is becoming progressively insufficient. These methods require a large number of assays to detect all possible GMOs present in the sample and thereby the development of multiplex PCR systems using combined probes and primers targeted to sequences specific to various GMOs is needed for detection of this increasing number of GMOs. Here we report on the development of a multiplex real-time PCR suitable for multiple GMO identification, based on the intercalating dye SYBR Green I and the analysis of the melting curves of the amplified products. Using this method, different amplification products specific for Maximizer 176, Bt11, MON810, and GA21 maize and for GTS 40-3-2 soybean were obtained and identified by their specific Tm. We have combined amplification of these products in a number of multiplex reactions and show the suitability of the methods for identification of GMOs with a sensitivity of 0.1% in duplex reactions. The described methods offer an economic and simple alternative to real-time PCR systems based on sequence-specific probes (i.e., TaqMan chemistry). These methods can be used as selection tests and further optimized for uniplex GMO quantification.KeywordsGMO; Detection; Real-time PCR; SYBR Green I; Melting temperatureDuring recent years, a large number of genetically modified organisms (GMOs)1 have been approved in the United States, the European Union, Canada, Japan, and other countries. The progressive tendency to increase both the cultivated areas and the number of modified traits is becoming evident [1]. The labeling normative [2]and[3] and the Japanese Ministries of Health and Welfare, and Agricultural Food and Fisheries [4] have encouraged the development and application of technologies aimed to detect and precisely identify the presence of GMO in food or food additives.The most accepted GMO detection methods are based on DNA, because of the high stability of this molecule under the extreme conditions used during processing of some food products [5]and[6]. GMO detection through PCR relies on parallel amplification of the transgene and of an endogenous reference gene that provides a control both for the lack on inhibition and for the amplificability of the target DNA in the sample. Additionally, for quantitative analyses, amplification of the reference gene provides an estimation of the total amount of target DNA present in the sample. Several conventional PCR systems targeting different regions of the introduced genes in the maize Maximizer event 176 [7], [8]and[9] and Bt11 [10] from Syngenta Seeds, the soybean GT 40-3-2 [11], [12], [13]and[14] or the YieldGard [15]and[16] and GA21 maizes from Monsanto [17], or the StarLink maize from Plant Genetics Systems [18] have been described. Moreover, conventional PCR systems suitable for use as species-specific endogenous controls have been published for soybean [19], maize [7], rapeseed [20], and potato and tomato [21]and[22].The simultaneous amplification of multiple sequences in a single PCR is expected to save considerable time and effort in GMO detection analyses, as it should allow decreasing the number of reactions required to assess the presence of all possible GMOs [23]. Multiplex conventional PCR systems that are able to detect up to five different GMO targets in a single assay reaction have been reported [24], [25]and[26]. The amplified fragments obtained in this assay are dissimilar enough to allow their identification in agarose gels, with fragments as long as 500bp used in the amplification reaction. Though highly suitable for qualitative analyses, this method exhibits poor detection limits which could be improved by using more sensitive detection techniques such as real-time PCR. This technique [27] has the potential for sensitive and specific identification of target sequences, allowing their accurate quantification. Moreover, the lack of subsequent manipulation steps reduces the risks of cross-contamination, allowing high-throughput results with easy automation of the assay. Real-time PCR systems using the TaqMan chemistry to identify and quantify the maize Maximizer 176, Bt11, and MON810 events and the soybean GTS 40-3-2 event have been developed [16], [17], [28], [29], [30], [31], [32], [33]and[34]. Nevertheless, implementation of these techniques to multiplexing real-time PCRs has not yet been done. Real-time PCR multiplex reactions would require the specific detection of the different fluorochrome dyes used to label each independent probe, which is difficult to achieve given the broad emission spectrum of the dyes used in real-time PCR assays [35]and[36]. Intercalating dyes such as SYBR Green I, with a high affinity for double-stranded DNA and enhanced fluorescence upon DNA binding [37], offer a good alternative as continuous monitoring of the amplified fragments fluorescence along with gradient changes in temperature can be used to determine the melting curves of these fragments. Thereby, though fluorescence in the SYBR Green I reaction is not sequence specific, it is possible to identify the amplified products by their melting temperature (Tm) [38], thus making multiplexing feasible.We report on the use of SYBR Green I-based melting curve determination assays in duplex PCRs targeted to (i) the GM-soybean GTS-40-3-2 and a soybean endogenous control and (ii) maize events Maximizer 176 and GA21. Furthermore, we used this method in a triplex reaction aimed to identify the maize events Maximizer 176, Bt11, and MON810. Using this technique, detection and identification of the PCR products could be attained without any need of further analyses, therefore these methods offer an efficient, reliable, and low-cost alternative to current methods for GMO identification.Materials and methodsPlant materialsPowdered certified reference materials with Maximizer 176, Bt11, and MON810 maize lines and GTS 40-3-2 soy event were from the Institute for Reference Materials and Measurements and commercialized by Fluka (Buchs, Switzerland). Leaves from maize event GA21, Lycopersicon esculentum var. Ailsa Craig, Solanum tuberosum var. Dsire, Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Columbia, Brassica napus, Brassica oleracea, Helianthus annuus, Hordeum vulgare, Oryza sativa, Sorghum bicolor, Zea diploperennis, and Zea mays cultivar W64A were from plants cultivated in green houses at the IBMB-CSIC. DNA extracted from Secale cereale, Triticum aestivum, Panicum miliaceum, Glycine max, Lens esculenta, Vicia faba, Phaseolus vulgaris, and Lupinus albus was provided within the framework of the Qpcrgmofood European project.Plant DNA isolation and quantificationGenomic DNA was isolated from 0.1 g of plant material using a cetyltrimethylammonium bromide-based protocol as described [39]. DNA concentration was spectrophotometrically quantified with a GeneQuant RNA/DNA Calculator (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech Europe GmbH, Freiburg, Germany). DNA concentrations were further assessed by agarose gel electrophoresis and ethidium bromide staining. UV-fluorescent emission was recorded and quantified using the Quantity One software (Bio-Rad Laboratories Inc., Hercules, CA) by comparison to known amounts of lambda phage molecular weight standards.
