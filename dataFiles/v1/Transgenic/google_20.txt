Transgenic Mouse FacilityThe UC Irvine Transgenic Mouse Facility (TMF) is a core facility that provides services on a recharge basis for making, breeding, genotyping, importing, and preserving genetically-modified mice and embryonic stem cells. In addition to academic clients at UCI, we also service academic investigators at several other sister UC-campuses and numerous other universities throughout the USA as well as providing these services to commercial clients.

"CRISPR" Cas9/gRNA genome editing services are available
In certain cases CRISPR Cas9/gRNA mediated gene editing can accelerate projects to modify the mouse genome. As of July 2016, the TMF has successfully completed 21 independent projects to modify the mouse genome via use of Cas9/gRNA. Most completed projects have involved introduction of point mutations, amino acid changes, loxP sites and exon deletions via Cas9/gRNA in combination with single-stranded oligodeoxynucleotide (ssODN) and homology dependent repair (HDR). This technology continues to evolve at a rapid pace and we routinely evaluate modifications of methods that may improve efficiency while using fewer animals.
Inquiries regarding gene targeting via Cas9 /gRNA should be directed to the TMFs Managing Director, Jon Neumann.
