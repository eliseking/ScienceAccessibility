Need a mouse model for your gene of interest?
Consider:
The Stanford Transgenic Research Facility
Room 0137 CCSR Building, Stanford, CA 94305. Tel: 650-725-6871
Operated by
Stanford Cancer Institute
at Stanford University School of Medicine
Partly supported by funds from Stanford
Cancer Institute, the Stanford Transgenic Mouse Research
Facility is set to produce your transgenic and knockout mouse models.
The facility provides low-cost DNA microinjection services, ES cell manipulation,
and microinjection services to all Stanford as
well as external investigators. The facility also provides services on
timed pregnant females, strain rederivation, embryo and sperm cryopreservation and
IVF procedures for resurrecting frozen sperms.
Dr. Barry Behr is the Interim
Director
of the facility with responsibility for its overall operation.
The facility
has an advisory board consisting of Dr. Michael Cleary
(Pathology), Dr.
Julien Sage (Pediatrics),
Dr. Sherri Green (Comparative Medicine), and Dr.
Dean Felsher (Oncology). Oversight is also
provided by the Cancer
Institute senior leadership to ensure that the needs of Cancer Institute
members are met. Dr. Hong Zeng and Dr. Jeewon Kim are Research Scientists; Denise Leong, Yun Song, Yanfeng Li, Albert Ho, Zhengdon Chen, and Matt Gamboa are research staff of the facility.
Note: If the work done with this Service Center produces data resulting in a figure in a publication, you are required to acknowledge the Service Center ("Stanford Transgenic Research Facility") in the publication. Further, if staff members of the facility provided significant experimental design, data interpretation, or other intellectual contribution (as evaluated by the PI), then it is expected that these individuals will be coauthors on the publication.
