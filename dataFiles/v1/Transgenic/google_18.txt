Transgenic Animal Facility Generation and Preservation of Genome-edited models
The Transgenic Animal Facility (TAF) was established in 1988 and has a long history of providing UW Madison researchers access to the latest technology for generating transgenic and gene targeted animals at a reasonable cost. They have been nationally recognized for their work in manipulating rat embryos and have been very successful in incorporating CRISPR/Cas9 technology into their program.
TAF provides additional related services such as embryo cryopreservation, sperm cryopreservation, IVF and strain rederivation. Off-campus users are welcome to contact us for rates and price quotes.
Facility staff provide the expertise, state-of-the-art laboratory space, and pathogen-free animal quarters necessary for the efficient production of transgenic and gene-edited mice and rats. Clients may receive guidance in grant write-ups, DNA and RNA preparation for microinjection, transgenic animal husbandry, and analysis of gene-edited animals.
