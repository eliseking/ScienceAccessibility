Transgenic Mouse Models
The TMM Core assists investigators with developing genetically engineered
rodent models of human diseases for studying mutant genes and investigating molecular mechanisms underlying pathological processes. Learn more
Welcome Thank you for visiting the Transgenic Mouse Model Core website of the Oregon Health and
Science University (OHSU). The Core is located in the Biomedical Research
Building in order to take advantage of the new pathogen-free barrier animal
facility. Currently, the TMM Core is generating CRISPR/cas9 knock-out and
knock-in,conventional knock-out, and
transgenic mice, as well as performing various other services (cryopreserving
mouse embryos and sperm, carrying out IVF) for the researchers of OHSU and
other organizations.
