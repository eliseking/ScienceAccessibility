Transgenic Construct Design
Standard transgenic constructs should contain all the 5' and 3' regulatory elements necessary for transgene expression; your gene of interest and/or marker gene; and restriction sites that allow isolation of a full length linear transgenic fragment for microinjection. Addition of sequences that potentially increase the level of transgene expression should be considered. A strategy for the detection of your transgene or its product (i.e., epitope tags on transgenic protein) should also be inherent in the construct design.Transgene as a complete transcriptional unitPromoters/enhancersTissue-specific promoters/enhancers: perform a literature search for previously identified tissue-specific promoterUbiquitouspromoters: ie, chicken -actin, cytomegalovirus (CMV) enhancer (CCAG or CAG promoter), histone H4 promoter3'UTRcDNA must have polyA tail for protein translationGenomic sequences with strong termination & poly A signals: ie, bovine growth hormone (bGH), SV40, rabbit -globin, 3' mouse protamine UTR/ polyASequences that can influence expression of integrated transgenePositive effects
Introns: increase efficiency of RNA processing and nuclear transport associated with RNA splicingHeterologous introns: BGH, SV40 intronInsulator sequences: overcome position effect variegation (Ref??)Negative effectsVector sequences remaining in the microinjection transgenic fragment
do not affect transgene integration rates but can significantly affect transgene expressioncan be recognized as foreign, thereby targeting the transgenic sequences for transcriptional inactivationExpression of integrated transgene constructs containing less than 100 bp of vector sequence are generally not affectedGene of Interest Sequencesgenomic DNA (exons & introns)cDNA (lacking introns)anti-sense RNAMarker Genes Track Transgene ExpressionTypes of marker genesLac/Z (from E. coli, encodes ?-galactosidase) or alkaline phosphatase: simple, protein produces can be visualized using histochemical or immunocytochemical methods at single cell level but not very sensitiveLucuferase (from firefly): very sensitive but must homogenize tissue to assess expressionFluorescent proteins: very sensitive, visual, no staining required, analysis in live tissue, isolation of cells using FACS, several different fluorephores available

MethodsPCR assay; fast method but can be unreliable for founder genotyping
Design primers that detect sequences unique to transgeneDesign transgene-specific probes that bridge gene-control element junctionSouthern Blot analysis; useful method for:
Founder genotypingAnalysis of transgene integration site(s)Determining transgene copy number and orientation (head to tail array)Assess homozygosity of transgenic animalsDetection of expressed gene productExpression of unique transgenic mRNATransgene may encodes truncated or shortened RNANot recommended for founder analysisDetection of transgenic proteinExpression of unique transgenic proteinDetection of expressed epitope/peptide tag (ie, myc, FLAG, HA)Detection of protein epitope using monoclonal antibodies (ie, FACS, Western blot)Support the Center for Genetic Medicine
