Abstract
Animal models of disease in genetically manipulated
mice are powerful tools in medical research, including the study of dementia.
The time and expense required to make genetically altered mice is considerable,
and the importance of this investment is amplified by the long time course of
most studies of dementia. Investigators need to be able to make informed
choices about the different strategies for transgenics and gene targeting in
order to minimize unwanted variation, and to maximize fidelity to the disease.
In recent years, large genomic fragments stably cloned in well-characterized
libraries, the means to manipulate their sequence, and the ability to make
transgenic mice from these clones in inbred strains have increased greatly the
power of the transgenic mouse. In addition, new embryonic cell lines from the
C57BL/6 inbred strain of mice have become widely adopted for gene targeting,
allowing knockins, knockouts and conditional alleles to be established on the
standard C57BL/6 background much more expeditiously than in the past. These
methods, the time required and the probability of success are reviewed with
respect to mouse models of dementia.
Introduction
Gene
targeting and transgenic technologies have different strengths and weaknesses
with respect to fidelity to the disease, minimized variation and avoidance of
unintended consequences. The generation of genetically manipulated mice for any
purpose involves significant time and expense. This investment is amplified in
the case of models of dementia because of the aging component in many dementia
models. My goal in the following is to help the investigator make wise choices
in selection of technologies such that unwanted variation is minimized and fidelity
to the disease can be maximized. This is not a cookbook of how to perform gene
targeting or transgenics aimed at transgenic or targeting cores, but is
intended to aid the investigator in making decisions about which approaches are
best suited for achieving their experimental goals while highlighting some of
the pitfalls associated with the different approaches.
Transgenics
and Gene Targeting
In
transgenics, DNA is randomly inserted into the genome by injecting the swelling
sperm nucleus shortly after fertilization (1). The injected embryos are transferred into recipient
female mice. About 20% of the offspring will have the injected DNA inserted
into their genome. Each of the transgene-positive offspring is used to
establish a line of offspring carrying that insertion of the transgene by
breeding founder animals to wild type mice of the appropriate strain.
In
gene targeting, changes are introduced into an endogenous gene using homologous
recombination with manipulated DNA from that gene (2, 3). Gene targeting is performed in embryonic stem (ES)
cells in culture. Because gene targeting is a rare event, drug selection
minigenes are incorporated into the targeting DNA construct, and then bona fide
gene targeted cell lines must be identified from among the cells surviving drug
selection. The fraction of correctly targeted cells in the cells surviving
selection can be as large as one-quarter, but can be much smaller. Cell lines
are screened for homologous recombination on one side of the targeted
construct, then positive cell lines are propagated and characterized in more
detail to ensure that homologous recombination occurred on both sides, and all
elements which should be introduced into the gene were in fact recombined in.
Correctly targeted cell lines are analyzed to ensure that they have the correct
number of chromosomes, since aneuploid cell lines rarely transmit through the
germ line. Euploid, correctly targeted cell lines are combined with recipient
embryos, and the chimeric embryos are transferred into a host female. The ES
cells and the host embryo are typically marked by different coat color genes,
and typically the chimeras are mated to mice of a chosen coat color such that
offspring derived from the ES cell component can be distinguished from those
derived from the host embryo. Half of the ES-derived offspring should carry the
targeted gene.
Genetic
Mechanism of Disease and Choice of Technologies
Consideration
must be given to the genetic mechanism of the disease to be modeled. Typical
genetic mechanisms of disease include mutations which eliminate gene function,
mutations which alter gene activity, and mutations which increase gene copy
number.
If
a disease results from complete loss of function (a null mutation), then the
gene can be inactivated by gene targeting (gene knockout). Both homozygous
recessive traits (both gene copies inactivated by mutation) and
haploinsufficient traits (one gene copy inactivated) can be modeled by gene
knockout.
If
a disease results from increased or novel activity of the gene product, then
either transgenes which express mutant product, or targeted sequence changes
(knockin) to the endogenous gene can be used. If the mutations lead to partial
loss of function, then gene targeting can be used to introduce a specific
compromising mutation into the endogenous gene (knockin).
If
the disease is due to increases in gene copy number, then transgenes can be
used to increase gene copy number.
Also,
consider that while many disease-causing mutations are not complete
loss-of-function mutations (null mutations), null mutations are the most
informative mutation for the normal function of the gene, and can be used in
conjunction with disease-causing mutations to better understand molecular
mechanisms.
Minimizing
Unwanted Variation
One
strength of animal models is that variation can be minimized, such that experiments
can have greater sensitivity. Minimized variation results if genetic
background, environment and epigenetic state are uniform. Of course, variation
in phenotype can arise directly if different mutations at the disease-causing
locus have different effects on gene activity, but this variation is apparent
and in the control of the investigator.
Variation
can arise through interaction of a disease-causing mutation with segregating
variants elsewhere in the genome. The effects of these gene-gene interactions
can be quite large (4), and these types of interactions affecting the
severity of the disease phenotype have been observed for models of dementia (5-8). Many mouse strains which have no genetic variation
at all are available--inbred strains--so variation due to variable gene-gene
interactions can be minimized. Genetic models can be generated directly on a
small number of inbred strains, or a genetic variant can be generated and
crossed onto the inbred strain of choice. The characteristics of inbred
strains, which ones are amenable to genetic manipulation and practical details
of breeding inbred model mice are discussed below.
Variable
gene expression at the disease-causing locus can arise due to epigenetic
variation. DNA methylation and chromatin structure are heritable from cell to
cell, and even from generation to generation in some cases. The problem is that
the epigenetic state is not completely stable and can switch stochastically,
from one permissive for expression, to one that is not. Most genes in the
genome probably do not have stochastic variation in epigenetic state, but it is
quite common at foreign DNA experimentally inserted into the genome,
particularly in intergenic regions. It is assumed that epigenetic silencing of
introduced DNA is a protective mechanism against foreign DNA, such as might
arise from viral genome insertion. The likelihood of silencing is influenced by
the nature of the inserted DNA and the epigenetic state of the DNA surrounding
the insertion (9-11). Importantly, variation in epigenetic state is
exacerbated with small transgenes inserted in large numbers at one site. Transgenes insert in direct (tandem,
head-to-tail) repeats at a single site. For small transgenes, the array can
contain hundreds of copies. The repetitive nature of the transgene array
promotes epigenetic silencing (12-14). Epigenetic silencing at a transgene array can vary
from cell to cell, can increase with age, and can vary from animal to animal (10, 12, 15). Transgene arrays, once silenced in the germ line,
usually remain stably silenced from generation to generation (16-18). Thus, it is important to monitor gene expression
from generation to generation in transgenic mice with large transgene arrays.
Modern
mouse housing practices seek to eliminate environmental variation through the
control of ventilation, temperature, humidity, noise, vibration, photoperiod,
enrichment, infectious agents and diet. Although housing and veterinary care of
the mice typically is managed by animal care staff and veterinarians of an
animal facility, investigators should take an active interest in the housing,
care and infectious disease state of their animals to ensure that stated
standards are met and procedures followed.
Environmental
perturbations can come from unexpected sources. Mouse housing units consist in
part of plastic which come into contact with the mice. When cages made from
polycarbonate and polysulfone degrade, they release the estrogenic compound
bisphenol A (19, 20). Polysulfone caging is more stable than
polycarbonate, releasing less bisphenol A (19). Visibly degraded or hazed plastics should be
removed from use.
Artifacts
of Genetic Manipulation
Genetic
manipulations occasionally have unintended consequences. Transgene insertions
can physically disrupt genes at their site of insertion. The frequency of
phenotypes arising from insertion site mutation by a transgene (almost 10%) is
higher than might be expected from random integration into the genome. The
higher than expected mutation rate results because transgenics generated by
pronuclear injection can generate large deletions and complex rearrangements at
the site of DNA integration (21-31). If a transgene cannot be made homozygous, or the
homozygous mice have an unexpected phenotype, then this may indicate that there
is an effect from the insertion site. Moreover, if an unexpected phenotype is
not seen in other lines of mice from different founder mice with the same
transgene, then the phenotype may be due to the insertion site. Thus, it is
prudent to generate multiple lines of transgenic mice from independent founder
animals and to compare the phenotypes of these lines.
In
addition to direct physical interruption of genes, integrations can also have
effects on the expression of neighboring genes (32-35). This more indirect effect has been observed in a
few well-characterized gene knockouts, but in principle this phenomenon could
apply to transgenes as well. Where indirect effects on neighboring genes have
been observed, the effect is due to a selectable marker minigene introduced
into the endogenous, mutated gene. In most cases where this phenomenon has been
observed, the affected neighboring genes are close to the targeted gene, and
have been closely related to the targeted gene. In gene knockouts, effects on
the expression of neighboring genes can be minimized by designing knockouts
with the drug resistance gene cassette flanked by recognition sequences for a
site-specific recombinase (such as Frt or LoxP sites for Flpe or Cre
recombinase, respectively). The drug resistance minigenes can be removed after
targeting by transient expression of recombinase in ES cells or by crossing the
knockout to a mouse which expresses recombinase in the germ line.
Individual
transgenic lines made with characterized promoters and small transgenes are
occasionally ectopically expressed. This aberrant expression may be due to
influences from the site of integration, and is observed more frequently with
weak promoters.
Inbred
Strains of Mice
A
large number of inbred strains of mice exist, but only a small number are
commonly used to make transgenics or gene targeted mice. The C57BL/6, 129 and
FVB inbred strains are commonly used to generate genetically altered mice.
Inbred strains are less robust than hybrid strains in knockout and transgenic
production, but if the experimental goals are best served with an inbred
strain, it is wise to start on an inbred strain to avoid the almost two and a
half years needed to cross the mice to a new background.
The
choice of strain depends on the characteristics of the strain including
susceptibility to the disease and whether other genetic variants of interest are
on that strain.
Inbred
strains differ in susceptibility to disease phenotype, as well as in
neuroanatomy, sensory acuity and proficiency in behavioral tests (36). The C57BL/6 inbred strain has relatively normal
neuroanatomy and is susceptible to dementia phenotypes (5-8, 37), and many genetic variants have been established on
C57BL/6J. C57BL/6J has age-related hearing loss (38), and is susceptible to dermatitis (39). 129 mice typically have a small corpus callosum and
perform poorly in learning tests (37, 40), and may have a reduced severity of dementia
phenotype (5). The FVB strain is blind due to retinal degeneration
and thus performs poorly in behavioral assays requiring vision (41-43). Fewer genetic variants are available on 129 and FVB
than on C57BL/6J. Although there are only a small number of studies thus far,
C57BL/6 and FVB mice appear to be more susceptible to both Alzheimer and
Huntington disease pathology than 129 mice.
In
the past, most gene targeting was done in ES cells from 129 mice. However,
recently, cell lines from C57Bl/6J and the closely related C57BL/6N have become
widely used (44, 45). In addition, transgenics can be made directly on
C57BL/6J (46).
Transgenics
Three
types of transgene will be considered: small, cDNA-based transgenes; large,
genomic DNA-based transgenes; and dual transgene (digenic) systems.
Small
cDNA-based transgenes consist of a promoter, a complete protein-coding sequence
from a cDNA and a polyadenylation signal cloned into a high-copy-number
plasmid. An intron is sometimes included in the construct to increase
expression (47, 48). These elements are cloned into the plasmid such
that the transgene can be liberated in one piece from the plasmid backbone by
digestion with restriction endonuclease(s), and the backbone-free construct
isolated from a gel. The backbone is not included in the injected DNA since the
backbone promotes epigenetic silencing (49, 50). The injected DNA makes an array of head-to-tail
copies, which inserts at a single site in the genome (1). The expression level of the transgene-encoded
products typically do not correlate with the number of copies of the transgene
which were inserted for these cDNA-based transgenes (12). Different transgenic founders can have different
expression levels, and this variation can be used to investigate if the
phenotype varies with transgene expression level. Expression from a transgene
of this kind can be considerably higher than that from the endogenous gene.
Promoters
which drive ubiquitous or tissue-specific transgene expression have been
developed. A list of characterized brain-specific promoters which have been
used in dementia models is listed in the supplementary material to Gotz and
Ittner (51).
Briefly, promoters which have been used to create
models of dementia include those from the Thy1 (Thy1.2), Prnp (PrP), Pdgfb
(Pdgf-beta, PDGF), Camk2a (CAMKII), Eno2 (NSE) and GFAP genes. These genes vary
in their spatial pattern of expression and the level of expression. The Thy1.2
promoter drives strong expression in most or all neurons beginning at early
postnatal stages (52, 53). The Prp promoter drives strong expression in
neurons in the hippocampus, Purkinje cells and a few other neuronal cell types (54). The PDGF promoter drives moderate expression in
neurons of the cortex and hippocampus (55). The CAMKII promoter drives postnatal expression in
forebrain-derived neurons (56). The NSE promoter drives strong expression in
post-mitotic neurons, beginning on embryonic day 9.5 (57). The GFAP promoter drives robust expression in
astrocytes. (58)
The
coding sequence typically is derived from a full length cDNA. Mutations or tags
can be incorporated into the coding sequence by many different methods.
Polyadenylation
signals are needed for transgene-encoded RNA to accumulate. The AAUAAA in the
3' untranslated region of typical mRNAs are not sufficient to promote 3' end
cleavage and polyadenylation in this context. Two different polyadenylation
sequences are in common use: the bovine growth hormone and SV40 polyadenylation
sequences (59, 60).
Given
the propensity of small transgenes to be epigenetically silenced in mice, and
in order to fully characterize different transgenic lines for expression, plan
to monitor expression of the transgene products. Ideally, the transgene-encoded
protein is monitored, rather than the RNA. This can be accomplished if the
protein is from a different species and species-specific antibodies are
available, if antibodies detect the transgene-encoded mutant form of the
protein, or the protein is tagged with an epitope.
Recently,
large genomic fragments containing entire genes have become easier to
manipulate to generate transgenic mice (61, 62). Large fragment genomic DNA libraries in bacterial
artificial chromosome (BAC) vectors have been made from many species, including
humans and many strains of mice. The average size of the cloned genomic DNA
(typically 150 kb) is such that most genes and the cis-acting sequences
required for their expression can be contained within a single clone (63). BAC clones are stable in their bacterial hosts, and
can be isolated with commercial large plasmid purification kits (64). Some of these libraries, both human and mouse, have
had many clones sequenced at both ends. The paired end sequences were used to
tile the clones on the genome assemblies (65-67). The partially sequenced clones are available for
purchase in their bacterial hosts. Many BAC genomic clones, when injected as
transgenes into mice, recapitulate the normal temporal and spatial pattern of
expression of the endogenous gene at comparable expression levels (63). A technology for introducing mutations into the BAC
clones, recombineering, is available (64, 68-70). If use of the recombineering technology will be
limited to a small number of constructs, it may be expedient to use a
commercial recombineering service.
Genomic
clones in BAC vectors are typically injected as intact circular molecules
including the vector. The DNA concatemerizes and a small number of intact
copies integrate at a single site (71). Unlike small, cDNA-based transgenes, the expression
level of these large transgenes correlates with copy number (71, 72). Epigenetic silencing has not been reported to be a
problem with these large transgenes, presumably because they resemble mouse
genes rather than foreign DNA. Detection of expression from unmodified mouse
BAC clones can be difficult because of similarity or identity to the endogenous
gene, thus use of human clones, or tagging or modifying a mouse coding sequence
by recombineering should be considered.
Large
genomic DNA fragments cloned in yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) vectors have
also been used to generate transgenic mice. Although YAC vector libraries have
larger DNA fragments on average, clones are much more prone to DNA chimerism,
are much more difficult to isolate and use to generate transgenics than BAC
clones (73).
Temporal
control of expression is possible with digenic transgene systems. The most
prevalent of these are the variants of the tetracycline-regulated transcription
factor (74-76). One transgene of the pair consists of a responder
transgene with the target coding sequence under control of a minimal promoter
and binding sites for the trans-acting factor. The activity of the trans-acting
factor is regulated by binding the tetracycline analogue doxycycline, which is
supplied in drinking water. The trans-acting factor is typically expressed from
a tissue-specific promoter in a second, independently established transgene.
The two transgenes are brought together by breeding. In this way, both timing
and tissue of expression can be precisely controlled. A number of well-characterized
driver genes are available.
Most but not all components of digenic
systems are small transgenes, and thus are susceptible to the epigenetic
silencing that affects cDNA-based transgenes. Therefore, monitoring of the
expression of both transgenes of the digenic system may need to be factored
into the research plan.
For
the creation of models of dementia, BAC transgenes have the advantages of
expression which better mimics the endogenous gene and relative resistance to
epigenetic silencing. For experiments which require high level expression of a
transgene product, the plasmid-based transgene approach works well. If control
over the timing of expression of the transgene product is desired, the
tetracycline-regulated system would be most suitable. The genetic background of
choice is the C57BL/6J inbred strain.
Gene
Targeting Strategies
In
gene targeting, an endogenous gene can be altered in a wide variety of ways: it
can be rendered nonfunctional by deleting essential sequences (gene knockout),
have sequences replaced or added (gene knockin) or made into a conditional
mutant (e.g. a floxed allele).
Because
the genomic DNA used to construct the targeting vector needs to be from the
same strain as the cell line (77), first a decision must be made about which ES cell
line to use. Historically, most gene targeting was done in lines derived from
the 129 inbred strain. Cell lines derived from 129 were better able to retain
their chromosomes in culture, and thus were more likely to transmit the
mutations through the germ line of mice (78). Recently, a number of excellent cell lines have
become available from C57BL/6N mice (45, 78-80). C57BL/6N and C57BL/6J diverged in 1951. There are a
handful of known genetic differences between the two strains, including a null
mutation in nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenase (Nnt) in C57BL/6J not
present in C57BL/6N (81). After targeting in C57BL/6N, the chimeras can be
bred to C57BL6/J directly. If the known genetic differences are a concern, they
can be eliminated in two crosses to C57BL6/J by monitoring for the variants in
the offspring.
End-sequenced
genomic clones in BAC vectors, which can be used for the construction of
targeting vectors, are available for both 129 and C57BL/6J (65, 66).
Gene
targeting has great fidelity to the genetics of the disease since the
endogenous gene is targeted. However, there are disadvantages to gene
targeting. Production of a mouse model by gene targeting takes more time than
by transgenics. Importantly, success is less assured with gene targeting that
with transgenics. Occasionally a gene targeting vector will not produce gene
targeted cell lines at all. It is not clear why targeting fails in these
instances, and the usual resolution involves increasing the extent of
homologous DNA or choosing a different part of the gene to target. In our
experience, about 80% of gene targeting vectors target successfully. In
addition, only about 80% of ES cell lines with a normal number of chromosomes
will transmit through the germ line. If multiple correctly targeted cell lines
were generated, then this second issue can be overcome by making chimeras with
two or more cell lines for each targeting experiment.
Time
Line for Transgenics and Gene Targeting
Moving
a mutation or transgene to an inbred strain requires nine consecutive crosses
to mice of the target strain, including at least one cross through each sex.
This process takes a minimum of slightly more than two years. DNA closely
linked to the gene variant will remain from the original strain on which the
variant was generated.
In
transgenics, it is 3 weeks from DNA injection to birth of offspring, 3 weeks to
weaning when the mice containing the injected DNA can be identified, and
another 3 to 5 weeks for females and males, respectively, to reach sexual
maturity. Transmission of the transgene into offspring requires 6 weeks to
weaned offspring. Thus a minimum of 15 to 17 weeks is required from DNA
injection until a transgene from a founder mouse is established in multiple
mice, the start of a line of transgenic mice.
In
gene targeting, it takes a minimum of 8 weeks to electroporate the DNA
construct and do an initial characterization of cell lines to identify
potential targeted clones, then a minimum of another 6 weeks to fully
characterize targeted cell lines for the construction of chimeras. From
injection of targeted embryonic stem cells into host embryos, it takes 12 weeks
for chimeras to reach sexual maturity, and another 6 weeks for weaned offspring
which will be tested for germ line transmission. Thus a minimum of 32 weeks is
required after the targeting vector is constructed to reach heterozygous, gene
targeted mice.
These
timelines do not include the time required to build DNA constructs or develop
assays to identify founder mice or targeted ES cells. The DNA constructs for
gene targeting are more complicated to construct, and the verification of gene
targeting is more involved than identifying transgenic mice.

Summary
The
advent of BAC genomic libraries and recombineering, combined with the ability
to make transgenics directly on the C57BL/6J inbred strain, have led to great
improvements in the generation of animal models of disease. In many cases, a
dementia model can be quickly established which has low variation and high
fidelity to the genetics of the disease. On the other hand, the recent
development of stable C57BL/6 ES lines has facilitated gene targeting. However,
gene targeting requires more time, and is less certain to succeed. The
strengths and weakness of different approaches are summarized in Table 1.
