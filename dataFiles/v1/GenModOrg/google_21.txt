Hidden GMO Exposures: Is It Possible To Avoid Them?
Written by Eleni Roumeliotou
Systematically bypassing public awareness and approval, GMOs have invaded a much wider market than the food industry. Dubious industrial uses surpass even the wildest imagination and show that our daily lives are far more contaminated by GMOs that we thought.
