GMOs
are regulated in the United States under the Coordinated Framework for
Regulation of Biotechnology, published in 1986, pursuant to previously existing
statutory authority regulating conventional products, with a focus on the
nature of the products rather than the process in which they are produced.
Plant
GMOs are regulated by the US Department of Agricultures Animal and Plant
Health Inspection Service under the Plant Protection Act. GMOs in food, drugs,
and biological products are regulated by the Food and Drug Administration under
the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and the Public Health Service Act.
GMO pesticides and microorganisms are regulated by the Environmental Protection
Agency pursuant to the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act and
the Toxic Substances Control Act. The form of regulation varies depending on
the type of GMO involved.
I. Introduction
The United
States does not have any federal legislation that is specific to genetically
modified organisms (GMOs). Rather, GMOs are regulated pursuant to health,
safety, and environmental legislation governing conventional products. The US
approach to regulating GMOs is premised on the assumption that regulation
should focus on the nature of the products, rather than the process in which
they were produced.[1]
Compared to
other countries, regulation of GMOs in the US is relatively favorable to their
development. GMOs are an economically important component of the biotechnology
industry, which now plays a significant role in the US economy.[2]
For example, the US is the worlds leading producer of genetically modified
(GM) crops. In 2012, of the 170.3 million hectares of biotech crops globally,
the United States accounted for 69.5 million, over 40% of the total.[3]
For several crops grown in the US, genetically engineered varieties now make up
the vast majority of the crop. In 2013, 93% of the soybeans, 90% of the
cotton, and 90% of the corn grown in the US were genetically engineered for
either herbicide tolerance or insect resistance.[4]
The US is not a
party to the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety.[5]
As a signatory but a nonparty to the parent Convention on Biological Diversity,
it cannot become a party to the Protocol.[6]
It has participated in meetings as a nonparty observer, however.[7]

II. Public and Scholarly
Opinion
A. Public Opinion
Public opinion on GMOs in the US is mixed. A series of
polls conducted over five years, from 2001 to 2006, found that public
understanding of biotechnology was relatively low, and that consumers were
relatively unaware of the extent to which their foods included genetically
modified ingredients.[8]
Support for the introduction of genetically modified foods into the food supply
held steady at 26 to 27% of respondents in favor over that time period, while
opposition to the introduction of such foods fell from 58 to 46% over the
period.[9]
Polls indicate strong support for labeling of GMO foods;
one recent poll found 93% of respondents supporting mandatory labeling.[10] The same poll found three-fourths
of Americans expressing concern regarding GMOs in food; nearly half indicating
they were aware that many processed or packaged foods contain genetically
modified ingredients; around half saying they would not eat genetically
modified vegetables, fruits, and grains; three-quarters stating they would not
eat genetically modified fish; and two-thirds saying they would not eat
genetically modified meat.[11]
B. Scholarly Opinion
Several
scientific organizations in the US have issued studies or statements
regarding the safety of GMOs indicating that there is
no evidence that GMOs present unique safety risks compared to
conventionally
bred products. These include the National Research Council,[12] the American Association for the
Advancement of Science,[13] and the American Medical Association.[14]
Groups in the US opposed to GMOs include some environmental
organizations,[15] organic farming organizations,[16] and consumer organizations.[17]
A substantial number of legal academics have criticized the USs approach to regulating GMOs.[18]
Back to Top
III. Structure of
Pertinent Legislation
There is no
comprehensive federal legislation specifically addressing GMOs. GMOs are
regulated under the general statutory authority of environmental, health, and
safety laws.
A policy
statement published in 1986 by the Executive Office of the President, Office of
Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) entitled the Coordinated Framework for
Regulation of Biotechnology (Coordinated Framework)[19] sets forth the basic approach to the regulation of GMOs in the US. The
Coordinated Framework was the outgrowth of efforts by an interagency
working group formed in 1984 to address whether the regulatory framework that
pertained to conventional products was adequate for products derived from
biotechnology. The working group concluded that existing laws as then
implemented, supplemented with new regulations, were adequate to address
regulatory needs.[20]
A proposed notice was published and comments were requested.[21] The final Coordinated Framework
policy notice confirmed that the regulatory jurisdiction over biotechnology
products would be allocated in the same manner as conventional products, using
existing laws governing conventional products.[22]
The
three main agencies involved in regulating GMOs are the US Department of
Agricultures Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), the Food and
Drug Administration (FDA), and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).
A. Animal and Plant Health
Inspection Service
APHIS
regulates the planting, importation, or transportation of GM plants pursuant to
its authority under the Plant Protection Act (PPA),[23] which authorizes the Secretary of
Agriculture to prohibit or restrict the importation, entry, exportation, or
movement in interstate commerce of any plant, plant product [etc.] if the
Secretary determines [it] is necessary to prevent the introduction . . . of a
plant pest or noxious weed within the United States.[24] By regulation, APHIS classifies most
GM plants as plant pests or potential plant pests and as regulated articles.[25] Under the PPA, a regulated article
must receive prior approval from APHIS before it is introduced.[26]
APHIS
grants authorization to use GM plants in three ways: through a notification
process, a permitting process, or a determination of nonregulated status.
1. Notification Procedure
The
notification procedure is available to plants that are not classified as
noxious weeds, or weeds in the release area, if certain criteria and
performance standards are met.[27] The criteria include that the plant must be a species that APHIS has
determined may be safely introduced; the genetic material must be stably
integrated; the expression of the genetic material must not result in plant
disease; etc.[28]
The performance standards govern shipment, storage, planting, and testing, and
are intended to prevent the plant from being released from containment.[29] When the applicant sends a
notification to APHIS, APHIS will respond within a prescribed time with an
acknowledgement or a denial.[30]
If the notification is denied, the applicant may apply for apermit.[31]
2. Permit Procedure
The
permit procedure requires an applicant to submit information concerning, among other
things, the donor organism, the recipient organism, the composition of the
regulated article; the expression of altered genetic material in the regulated
article and the molecular biology of the system used to produce the article;
the locality where the donor and recipient organisms and the regulated article
were developed; the purpose of the regulated article; the quantity to be
introduced; processes to prevent release; the intended destination, use, and
distribution; and the final disposition of the regulated article.[32]
If APHIS grants the permit, it is subject to conditions designed to ensure both
that the regulated article remains contained and that APHIS can maintain
regulatory oversight.[33]
Failure to comply with the conditions can result in withdrawal of
thepermit.[34]
3. Determination of Nonregulated Status
GM plants that have been tested and have been shown not to pose
a risk may be eligible for a determination of nonregulated status.[35] A petition for determination of
nonregulated status must include detailed biological information on the
regulated article and the recipient organism, published and unpublished
scientific studies, data from field tests, and other information designed to
assist APHIS in determining whether the plant constitutes a pest.[36] Upon receipt of a petition, APHIS
publishes a notice in the Federal Register and allows sixty days for
public comment.[37]
APHIS has 180 days to approve in whole or part or deny the petition.[38]
B. Food and Drug Administration
The
FDA regulates the safety of all human and animal food products in the US (other
than meat, poultry, and eggs), as well as drugs and biological products.
1. Food
The
FDAs primary statutory authority is the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act
(FFDCA),[39] which authorizes the agency to regulate, among other things, adulterated food,[40] defined as food that contains any
poisonous or deleterious substance that may render it deleterious to health,[41] and food additives,[42] which include any substance [that
may] becom[e] a component or otherwise affect[] the characteristics of any
food.[43]
The FFDCA prohibits the sale of adulterated or misbranded food.[44]
Under
the FFDCA, substances added to food can be classified either as food
additives, which require approval from the FDA that they are safe before they
can be marketed,[45] and substances added to food classified as generally recognized as safe
(GRAS), as to which preapproval is not needed.[46]
In a
1992 policy statement, the FDA reaffirmed that in most cases it would treat
foods derived from GMOs like those derived from conventionally bred plants, and
that most foods derived from GM plants would be presumptively GRAS. However,
with respect to a GMO product that differs significantly in structure,
function, or composition from substances found currently in food, premarket
approval of the substance as a food additive would be required.[47]
The
FDA encourages developers of new plant varieties intended for food use,
including GMOs, to engage in a consultation procedure with the FDA, in order
to ensure that human food and animal feed safety issues or other regulatory
issues (e.g. labeling) are resolved prior to commercial distribution.[48] The consultation procedure is meant
to enable the FDA to determine if regulatory action is needed with respect to
food derived from the new variety such as significantly increased levels of
plant toxicants or anti-nutrients, reduction of important nutrients, new
allergens, or the presence in the food of an unapproved food additive.[49] Among the issues subject to
consultation is the food safety of new proteins in new plant varieties,
including those developed through genetic engineering.[50] The FDA makes detailed information
regarding completed consultations publicly available.[51]
2. Animals
The
FDA also asserts jurisdiction over genetically engineered animals, pursuant to
its authority to regulate new animal drugs (NADs) under the FFDCA.[52] Under the FFDCA, NADs are deemed
generally unsafe unless the FDA has approved a New Animal Drug Application
(NADA) for the particular use of the drug.[53]
Except in cases in which the FDA exercises discretion to decline to require
compliance,[54] or where the drug is only for investigational use and thus need only conform to
specified exemptions,[55] the FDA requires a genetically engineered (GE) animal to be the subject of an approved
NADA based on a demonstration that it is safe and effective for its intended
use.[56]
A NADA for a GE animal must include information on the animals identification;
chemistry; clinical purpose; labeling; components and composition;
manufacturing methods, facilities, and controls; safety and effectiveness;
environmental impact; and other information.[57]
3. Drugs
The
FDA also has regulatory authority over drugs generally. Companies interested
in introducing a new drug into the US market in most cases must submit a New
Drug Application (NDA) to the FDA, which must include extensive information and
data on the drugs safety and effectiveness, such as the drugs chemistry,
manufacture, animal and in vitro studies, clinical data, and the like.[58] Drugs developed through genetic
engineering must go through the same NDA process as other types of drugs.
4. Biological Products
The
FDA also regulates medical products classified as biological products, which
includes vaccines, serums, blood products, and the like, under relevant
provisions of the Public Health Service Act (PHSA).[59] Biological products, whether
involving genetic modification or not, must be licensed by the FDA before they
can be introduced. The licensing procedure for biological products requires
submission to the FDA of detailed information on laboratory and clinical
studies, manufacturing methods, and other information relevant to whether they
are safe and effective for their intended purpose.[60]
C. Environmental Protection Agency
The
EPA regulates pesticides and microorganisms developed through genetic
engineering.
1. Pesticides
The
EPA regulates the manufacture, sale and use of pesticides under the Federal
Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA).[61] Under FIFRA, pesticides must not
cause unreasonable adverse effects on the environment,[62] which is defined to include both
safety to the environment and safety in food for consumption.[63] FIFRA requires all pesticides to be
registered with the EPA before they can be distributed commercially.[64] Pesticides must be tested and shown
to be safe before they can be registered.[65]
A registration application must include information regarding testing, identity
of the product, draft labeling, information on tolerance of residues, and other
safety-related information.[66]
Pursuant
to its authority under FIFRA, the EPA regulates plants that are genetically
modified to produce substances intended to control pests as to both their
environmental safety and their safety in food, termed plant-incorporated
protectants (PIPs).[67]
The standard registration procedures for pesticides apply to PIPs, unless they
are made exempt by regulation.[68]
PIPs are exempt from FIFRA registration if the PIP is used in a crop used in
food and its residues are exempt from regulation under the FFDCA,[69] if the PIP is an inert ingredient
listed as exempt by the EPA,[70] or if the PIP is from a plant that is sexually compatible with the recipient
plant.[71]
With respect to those PIPs that are exempt, if the producer of the PIP obtains
information regarding adverse effects from the PIP on human health or the
environment, it must share it with theEPA.[72]
2. Microorganisms
The
EPA also has authority to regulate GMOs under the Toxic Substances Control Act
(TSCA).[73]
The TSCA authorizes the EPA to regulate chemical substances that may present an
unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment.[74] Manufacturers of covered substances
must submit a premanufacture notification to the EPA.[75] The EPA has determined that GMO
microorganisms are chemical substances subject to regulation under the TSCA.[76] The EPA has established regulations
specifically for microorganisms that require submission of a Microbial
Commercial Activity Notice (MCAN) before they are used for commercial purposes.[77] The Notice must include information
describing the microorganisms characteristics and genetic construction;
byproducts of its manufacture, use, and disposal; health and environmental
effects data; and other information.[78]
D. National
Environmental Policy Act
The
National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA)[79] requires federal agencies in some cases to prepare Environmental Assessments
(EAs) of federal actions, such as adopting a policy or approving a permit, to
determine if they are likely to significantly impact the environment.[80] If a federal action is likely to
have a significant impact, the agency must prepare a more detailed evaluation
called an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS).[81] Federal agency approvals of GMOs
may require an EA or an EIS in some circumstances.[82]
E. State Law
State
law generally plays little role in the regulation of GMOs in the US. The federal
preemption doctrine, which bars conflicting state regulation when Congress
intends federal regulation to occupy a particular field, precludes many aspects
of state regulation of GMOs.[83]
A
rare example in which one states law is more stringent than federal law on
GMOs involves a bioengineered tropical aquarium fish known as the GloFish,
which is unregulated at the federal level,[84] but has been banned by the California Fish and Game Commission.[85]
Some
municipal governments in the US have banned GMO crops. For example, in
California, the counties of Marin and Mendocino have enacted ordinances
forbidding the cultivation of GMOs.[86]
In Hawaii, Kauai County and Hawaii County similarly have banned the cultivation
of most GMO crops.[87]
Back to Top
IV. Restrictions on Research,
Production, and Marketing
The nature of restrictions on
GMOs with respect to research, production and marketing in the US vary with the
different regulatory regimes that cover various aspects of genetic
modification.
A. Animal and Plant Health
Inspection Service
The introduction of GM plants
requires prior approval from APHIS, by means of a notification, permitting, or
a determination of nonregulated status procedure. (See Part III(A), above.)
B. Food and Drug Administration
1. Foods
The
FDA regards most GMO foods as presumptively falling within the category of
generally regarded as safe, thus not needing premarket approval, but a GMO
product that differs significantly in structure, function, or composition from
substances found currently in food requires premarket approval as a food
additive. (See Part III(B)(1), above.)
2. Animals
In most cases, the FDA requires a genetically engineered animal to be
approved by means of a New Animal Drug Application based on a demonstration
that it is safe and effective for its intended use. (See Part III(B)(2),
above.)
3. Drugs
FDA requires those wishing to
introduce a new drug into
the US market, whether it involves genetic modification or not, to submit a New
Drug Application (NDA) to the FDA, with detailed information on the drugs
safety and effectiveness. (See Part III(B)(3), above.)
4. Biological Products
The FDA requires all biological products, regardless of whether or not they are
developed by genetic modification, to be licensed by FDA before they can be
introduced, with detailed information on whether they are safe and effective
for their intended purpose. (See Part III(B)(4), above.)
C. Environmental Protection Agency
Under FIFRA, the EPA requires all pesticides to be registered
prior to commercial distribution, and the registration must include information
on their safety. The EPA also requires PIPs to comply with the pesticide
registration procedures, unless they meet the criteria for exemption from these
procedures. (See Part III(C)(1), above.)
Under TSCA, the EPA requires
those wishing to use microorganisms
for commercial purposes to submit a Microbial Commercial Activity Notice
(MCAN). (See Part III(C)(2), above.)
D. Labeling of GMOs
There is no law in the US
requiring that GMO foods or foods with GMO ingredients be labeled to so
indicate. Proposed federal legislation, the Genetically Engineered Food
Right-to-Know Act,[88] which would mandate labeling of any GMO food or food with a genetically
modified ingredient, has been introduced in the last several Congresses, but
has never advanced beyond the committee stage in either chamber. At the state
level, a 2012 California initiative mandating labeling of GMO foods, and a
similar 2013 Washington State initiative, both failed.[89]
The FDA has regulatory
authority to prevent false and misleading labeling of foods and drugs. With
respect to genetically engineered foods, the FDA has stated in policy documents
that if a GM food product is not materially different from its traditional
counterpart, there is no need to label or change the name of the product, but
name changes are appropriate when a food from a GM plant is so different from
its traditional counterpart that the usual name no longer adequately describes
the new food, or if there is a safety issue to which consumers should be
alerted, such as the presence of allergens.[90]
Back to Top
V. Restrictions on Releasing
Organisms into the Environment
Because US regulation of GMOs
focuses on the nature of the products, rather than the process in which they
were produced, the extent to which there are restrictions on releases of GMOs
into the environment depends on the GMOs in question. (See the discussion of
the different regulatory regimes for different types of GMOs, Part III, above.)
Back to Top
VI. Restrictions on GMOs in
Foodstuffs
GMOs
are not restricted categorically from the US food supply. As discussed above,
the FDA treats foods derived from GMOs like those
derived from conventionally bred plants, and therefore most foods derived from
GM plants are classified as presumptively generally recognized as safe.
However, with respect to a GMO product that differs significantly in
structure, function, or composition from substances found currently in food,
premarket approval of the product is required. (See Part III(B)(1), above.)
Back to Top
VII. Liability Regime
All of the various statutory
schemes under which GMOs are regulated in the US provide for civil and criminal
penalties. For example, violations of the PPA are subject to substantial civil
or criminal penalties;[91] knowingly importing or moving any regulated article for sale or distribution in
violation of the PPA is punishable by a fine, imprisonment up to five years, or
both.[92]
The liability provisions of the FFDCA list several practices that can lead to
significant civil or criminal penalties, including imprisonment.[93]
Violations of FIFRA and TSCA similarly are subject to civil or criminal
penalties.[94]
Back to Top
VIII. Judicial Decisions /
Prominent Cases
A landmark case
of significance in the early development of the US biotechnology industry was
the US Supreme Courts 1980 decision in Diamond v. Chakrabarty,[95] holding that genetically engineered microorganisms can be patented. This
decision contributed to a revolution in
biotechnology that has resulted in the issuance of thousands of patents, the
formation of hundreds of new companies, and the development of thousands of
bioengineered plants and foodproducts.[96]
Outside of
patent law, however, the role of the US courts in shaping regulatory policy
with respect to GMOs has been limited. A common theme among many court
decisions on GMOs has been the judiciarys deference to agency expertise in
determining how to regulatethem.
The Supreme
Courts decision in Monsanto Co. v. Geertson Seed Farms[97] involved a challenge under NEPA to APHISs decision to issue a determination of
nonregulated status to Monsantos Roundup Ready Alfalfa (RRA), a genetically
engineered variety of alfalfa, after making a finding of no significant
impact determination instead of preparing an environmental impact statement
(EIS). The district court ruled that an EIS was required, and as a remedy
enjoined APHIS from deregulating RRA, in whole or in part, pending completion
of the EIS, and also enjoining almost all planting of RRA nationwide.[98]
The Supreme Court reversed, ruling that the district court exceeded its
authority in enjoining APHIS from partially deregulating RRA and enjoining the
planting of RRA. It concluded that APHIS should be allowed to structure a
partial deregulation order while completing the EIS.[99]
In Alliance
for Bio-Integrity v. Shalala,[100] the plaintiffs challenged the FDAs 1992 policy statement that GMO foods that are similar to conventional varieties would
be presumptively deemed generally recognized as safe (GRAS)[101] and that they need not be labeled.[102] The district court declined to
rule that the FDAs decision that genetic modification does not materially
alter foods and to presume GMO foods are GRAS was arbitrary and capricious,
stating that the rational for [court] deference [to agency decision making] is
particularly strong when the [agency] is evaluating scientific data within its
technical expertise.[103]
As to labeling, it said that given FDAs decision on the GRAS issue, it would
also find that the FDAs interpretation of the FFDCAs labeling requirement was
reasonable.[104]
Other GMO cases have
similarly displayed the tendency of US courts to defer to agency
decisionmaking.[105]

animals. 21 U.S.C.  321(v). The FDA reasons that the rDNA construct in a
GE animal that is intended to affect the structure or function of the body of
the GE animal, regardless of the intended use of products that may be produced
by the GE animal, and thus all GE animals are NADs for purposes of

could regulate all GE animals, it has determined it will decline to regulate
those that are under the jurisdiction of other agencies. Id. at 7.
