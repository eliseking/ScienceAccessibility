Welcome to Transgenic Research; the only journal to comprehensively cover animal and plant transgenic technology
A valuable forum forum for ideas in all areas of transgenic and genome editing technology
Covers research in transgenic and genome edited higher organisms
100% of authors who answered a survey reported that they would definitely publish or probably publish in the journal again
Transgenic Research publishes research in transgenic and genome edited higher organisms including their production, properties resulting from the transgene or genome edit, use as experimental tools, exploitation and application, and application. The journal bridges the gap between fundamental and applied science in molecular biology and biotechnology.Coverage includes studies on transgenic and genome edited animals and plants in which insertion of transgenes, including modification of endogenous genes by any route or vehicle. Investigations into the physiology, biochemistry, molecular biology, development, genomics, genetics, behaviour and exploitation of such transgenic organisms are covered. Transgenic Research provides a valuable forum for the cross-fertilization of ideas and techniques in all areas of transgenic and genome editing technology in plants and animals.

Transgenic Research is a bimonthly international journal dedicated to the rapid publication of research in transgenic and genome edited higher organisms including their production, properties resulting from the transgene or genome edit, use as experimental tools, exploitation and application. Manuscripts focusing on biotechnological applications are strongly encouraged. Related intellectual property, public perception, ethical issues, societal impact and regulatory aspects also fall within the scope of the journal. Transgenic Research provides a valuable forum for the cross-fertilization of ideas and techniques in all areas of transgenic and genome editing technology in plants and animals, aiming to bridge the gap between fundamental and applied science in molecular biology and biotechnology.In addition to original research papers, Transgenic Research includes timely short communications reporting significant developments in methodology and experimental transgenic higher organisms. Review articles are welcome, but authors are encouraged to communicate with a member of the Editorial Board prior to submission to ensure their proposed review fits the aims and scope of Transgenic Research. Reviews should not be descriptive; rather they should present the most up-to-date information on the subject in a dispassionate and critical way.
