Transgenic Center
The Boston University Transgenic Facility was established to assist investigators in the generation of transgenic and knock-out mice. The facility performs embryonic injections of DNA or embryonic stem cells for the production of genetically altered animal models. This is done through the use of a Leitz inverted microscope, which gives the injectionist the 3 dimensional views necessary for the introduction of DNA or es cells into an embryo.
The Transgenic facility also offers a number of other services including, but not limited to cryopreservation of embryos, and rederivation of mouse lines infected with pathogens. The cryopreservation of embryos is done by slowly freezing the embryos to -80 degrees at a rate of .5 degrees per minute.
Please visit our website for more information on all of our services, or contact us for scientific help needed to pursue your project.
