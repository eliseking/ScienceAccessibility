Extensive information about the sequence of both human and mouse DNA suggests that mouse and human genes are similar and appear to serve similar functions to the extent that changes in the equivalent gene usually leads to similar inherited diseases. Our unit provides services for the production of genetically modified mice to be used as models to understand human diseases. The creation of genetically altered mice requires specialized techniques and central provision has significant advantages by providing a pool of experience and expertise that reduce and refine the numbers of mice required to generate new genetically altered lines.
At the Transgenic Service Facility of EMBL-Monterotondo, many gene targeting projects, DNA injection projects and mouse line rederivations are completed every year and for such purpose, our Transgenic Service unit provides a wide spectrum of standard and advanced alternative techniques. Our service produces many lines of mice and many more are imported from centres around the world.
