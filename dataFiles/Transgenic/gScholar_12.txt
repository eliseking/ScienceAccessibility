To study the interaction between A and tau and their effect on synaptic function, we derived a triple-transgenic model (3Tg-AD) harboring PS1M146V, APPSwe, and tauP301L transgenes. Rather than crossing independent lines, we microinjected two transgenes into single-cell embryos from homozygous PS1M146V knockin mice, generating mice with the same genetic background. 3Tg-AD mice progressively develop plaques and tangles. Synaptic dysfunction, including LTP deficits, manifests in an age-related manner, but before plaque and tangle pathology. Deficits in long-term synaptic plasticity correlate with the accumulation of intraneuronal A. These studies suggest a novel pathogenic role for intraneuronal A with regards to synaptic plasticity. The recapitulation of salient features of AD in these mice clarifies the relationships between A, synaptic dysfunction, and tangles and provides a valuable model for evaluating potential AD therapeutics as the impact on both lesions can be assessed.IntroductionAlzheimer's disease (AD), a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that is the most common cause of dementia in the elderly, is characterized by two hallmark lesions: diffuse and neuritic plaques, which are predominantly composed of the A peptide, and neurofibrillary tangles, composed of filamentous aggregates of hyperphosphorylated tau protein (Selkoe, 2001). Loss of neuronal synaptic density and synapse number represent another invariant feature of the disease that appears to precede overt neuronal degeneration DeKosky and Scheff 1990andScheff et al. 1991. Notably, the memory and cognitive decline observed in AD patients correlates better with the synaptic pathology than either plaques or tangles, and thus, synaptic dysfunction is likely the most significant factor contributing to the initial stages of memory loss Dickson et al. 1995, Flood and Coleman 1990, Masliah et al. 2001, Sze et al. 1997andTerry et al. 1991.Gene-targeted and transgenic mice have proven to be invaluable for modeling various aspects of AD neuropathology, although no mouse model fully recapitulates its entire neuropathological spectrum (Wong et al., 2002). Numerous models have successfully replicated amyloid plaque deposition, generally by deriving mice with relatively high levels of APP overexpression, and inclusion of a mutant PS1 allele can accelerate the deposition rate as well as exacerbate the pathological severity. The discovery of tau gene mutations in frontotemporal dementia with parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 kindreds facilitated the development of tauopathies in transgenic mice Gotz et al. 2001a, Higuchi et al. 2002andLewis et al. 2000. One surprising aspect of the overwhelming majority of extant AD models has been that the successful development of one hallmark pathological lesion has in and of itself been insufficient to trigger the development of the other signature lesion. Consequently, the concomitant manifestation of both plaques and tangles has required the introduction of multiple transgenes into the same mouse, which has generally been achieved by crossing several independent transgenic lines, or alternatively, by microinjecting pathological protein into the brains of single-transgenic mice Gotz et al. 2001bandLewis et al. 2001.Here, we describe the development of a novel triple-transgenic model (3Tg-AD). Instead of crossing three independent lines, we derived our transgenic model by directly introducing two additional transgenes into the germline of a genetically modified mouse. We report that (to our knowledge) this is the first transgenic model to develop both plaque and tangle pathology in AD-relevant brain regions. The 3Tg-AD mice develop extracellular A deposits prior to tangle formation, consistent with the amyloid cascade hypothesis. These mice exhibit deficits in synaptic plasticity, including long-term potentiation (LTP) that occurs prior to extracellular A deposition and tangles but is associated with intracellular A immunoreactivity. Double-transgenic mice (2Tg) lacking the human APP transgene (but containing PS1M146V and tauP301L) do not develop any extracellular plaques nor do they show any significant intraneuronal A immunoreactivity. Notably, the 2Tg mice do not exhibit any LTP deficits, despite expressing the tau transgene to comparable levels as the 3Tg-AD mice. Therefore, such findings suggest a novel pathophysiologic role for intraneuronal A and indicate that synaptic dysfunction is a proximal defect in the pathobiology of AD, preceding extracellular plaque formation and tangles. These 3Tg-AD mice will be useful for studying the impact of A and tau on synaptic plasticity and for evaluating the efficacy of anti-AD therapies in mitigating the neurodegenerative effects mediated by both signature lesions.ResultsDerivation and Characterization of 3Tg-AD MiceRather than crossing three transgenic lines, we comicroinjected two independent transgenes encoding human APPSwe and human tauP301L (both under control of the mouse Thy1.2 regulatory element) into single-cell embryos harvested from homozygous mutant PS1M146V knockin (PS1-KI) mice (Figure 1A). Because rarely does a single copy of any transgene integrate into a particular locus, we reasoned there was a high probability that the tau and APP transgene cassettes would likely cointegrate into the same site. Six founder lines were identified, five of which were found to harbor all three transgenes. Founder mice were backcrossed to PS1-KI mice. Genotype analysis by Southern blotting indicated that the tau and APP transgenes integrated at the same locus in the majority of the founder lines (data not shown). In at least two lines (B1 and G6), the transgenes appeared to cointegrate at the same locus based on analysis of the transmission frequency, which showed that each transgene did not independently assort in subsequent generations (Table 1). Therefore, comicroinjection of different transgenes appears to be a viable and effective means of generating multitransgenic mice.
