regulation identifies genetically engineered crops through a product-based policy; that is, if the final product contains transgenic material, then it is considered genetically engineered.Sidebar: Regulatory status of transgrafted plants is unclearIn contrast, transgenic mice, created to shed light on the mechanism of a gene or the path of a disease at the cellular or molecular level, are less simple.Not so generic mice: Japanese companies venture into the transgenic mouse tradeAccordingly, the joint research group has concluded that the transgenic rice has a property to effectively induce oral immune tolerance.National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences, Others Confirm Allergy Alleviating Effect of Transgenic RiceThe transgenic models we optimized here are based on the fundamental design of composite reporter gene constructs with a hormone-sensitive regulatory region upstream of a fluorescent protein cDNA.A rapid, physiologic protocol for testing transcriptional effects of thyroid-disrupting agents in premetamorphic xenopus tadpolesHe did not say how long it would take for the transgenic plants to be ready for field trials.Research body develops genetically modified rubberMoreover, almost none of the original metolachlor remained in the transgenic plant's growth medium, while one-quarter of the herbicide persisted in media hosting standard plants, the researchers report in an upcoming Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry.Rice with a human touch: engineered grain uses gene from people to protect against herbicidesThis novel little creature--a one-and-a-half-inch freshwater fish called a Zebrafish (Danio rerio), with genetically modified bio-fluorescent or light reflecting cells in its tissue--is the first widely marketed transgenic pet in the world.The atomic fish: the rising controversy of genetically modified petsRio Grande do Stir farmers lobbied hard to get permission to produce modified soy, spearheading the bill that would permanently open the door to transgenic crops, according to environmental groups.Bean counting: a Brazilian law could rid the world of the all-natural soybeanOthers have taken an extremist approach to ending transgenic research.Clean gene trees.
