Abstract
Following the transfer into fertilized mouse eggs of recombinant genes composed of the upstream region of the rat insulin II gene linked to sequences coding for the large-T antigen of simian virus 40, large-T antigen is detected exclusively in the beta-cells of the endocrine pancreas of transgenic mice. The alpha- and delta-cells normally found in the islets of Langerhans are rare and disordered. Well-vascularized beta-cell tumours arise in mice harbouring and inheriting these hybrid oncogenes.
