Mice have been generated that are transgenic for the 5 end of the human HD gene carrying (CAG)115(CAG)150 repeat expansions. In three lines, the transgene is ubiquitously expressed at both mRNA and protein level. Transgenic mice exhibit a progressive neurological phenotype that exhibits many of the features of HD, including choreiform-like movements, involuntary stereotypic movements, tremor, and epileptic seizures, as well as nonmovement disorder components. This transgenic model will greatly assist in an eventual understanding of the molecular pathology of HD and may open the way to the testing of intervention strategies.IntroductionHuntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant progressive neurodegenerative disorder (Harper 1991). The onset of symptoms is generally in midlife although it can range from early childhood to >70 years. Anticipation is observed, predominantly when the disease is inherited through the male line, with the result that 70% of juvenile cases inherit the disease from their father. The symptoms have an emotional, motor, and cognitive component. A detailed description of all aspects of HD can be found in Harper 1991. Chorea is a characteristic feature of the motor disorder and is defined as excessive spontaneous movement, irregularly timed, randomly distributed, and abrupt. It can vary from being barely perceptible to extremely severe. It involves all parts of the body, can have repetitive and stereotypic elements, and may have a pseudopurposive appearance (Harper 1991). Other frequently observed motor abnormalities include dystonia (sustained muscle contraction), rigidity, bradykinesia (abnormally slow movements), oculomotor dysfunction, and tremor. Cerebellar dysfunction, upper motorneuron abnormalities, epilepsy, and myoclonus (brief shock-like muscle jerks) are rare except in the juvenile form of the disease, which commonly presents with a Parkinsonlike rigidity. Voluntary movement disorders include fine motor incoordination, dysarthria (impairment of articulation), and dysphagia (difficulty in swallowing). The emotional disorder is commonly depression and irritability, and the cognitive component comprises a subcortical dementia. The biochemical basis of this disease is not understood, and there is no effective therapy.The HD mutation results in the expansion of a polyglutamine (polygln) tract in a large 350 kDa protein of unknown function (Huntington's Disease Collaborative Research Group, 1993). The normal and expanded HD allele sizes have been defined as CAG637 and CAG35121 repeats, respectively. An inverse correlation between age of onset and repeat length is most pronounced for juvenile HD for which the longest repeats have been observed (Huntington's Disease Collaborative Research Group, 1993; Telenius et al. 1993). Despite the selective cell death, the HD transcript is ubiquitously expressed ( Strong et al. 1993). The polyglutamines are successfully translated and the huntingtin protein (htt) products arising from expanded alleles have been identified in protein extracts from HD patients ( 9and27).CAG/gln expansion has been found to be the causative mutation in five neurodegenerative diseases for which the gene has been cloned. In addition to HD, these include spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) (La Spada et al. 1991), spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) (Orr et al. 1993), dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) (Koide et al. 1994), and Machado Joseph disease (MJD or SCA3) (Kawaguchi et al. 1994). Many aspects of the genetics and molecular biology are common to these diseases. They are autosomal dominant (with the exception of X-linked SBMA) and show varying degrees of anticipation on paternal transmission. The size of the normal and expanded CAG repeat ranges are comparable, and available data indicate that age of onset correlations and patterns of repeat stability are reproduced. A similar ubiquitous expression pattern is also characteristic, and the presence of the expanded forms of ataxin-1 (SCA1 protein) and atrophin-1 (DRPLA protein) in lysates from patient tissues have been observed (22and31).Despite the otherwise apparent universality of this mutation, the patterns of cell death differ between these diseases. In HD, the most striking atrophy occurs in the caudate nucleus, which is often reduced to a rim of tissue. The putamen and globus pallidus also undergo atrophy, and there are subtle changes in the cerebral cortex (Vonsattel et al. 1985). SBMA is a form of motor neuron disease with both spinal and bulbar motor neuron involvement (Kennedy et al. 1968). The SCA1 and SCA3 spinocerebellar ataxias are clearly distinguished by major neuropathological features: Purkinje cell, pontine nuclei, and inferior olivary nuclei degeneration in SCA1 (Zoghbi et al., 1993) and pontine nuclei and the molecular layer of the cerebellum in SCA3 (Durr et al. 1996). In DRPLA, neuropathology includes the cerebellar dentate nucleus, globus pallidus, red and subthalamic nuclei, Purkinje cells, brain stem tegmentum, and the lateral corticospinal tract (Takahashi et al. 1988). The proteins containing the polygln repeats are otherwise unrelated. In SBMA, the repeat lies within the androgen receptor (La Spada et al. 1991), while the others are in novel genes of unknown function. Subcellular localization suggests differing roles for these proteins (3, 22, 27and31).It is essential that transgenic models of these diseases are developed. There have been two previous reports of a neurological phenotype observed in mice transgenic for a protein carrying a polygln repeat expansion. The first used a SCA1 cDNA construct with (CAG)82 under the control of a Purkinje cell specific promoter (Burright et al. 1995). Three heterozygous lines overexpressing the SCA1 transcript by 10- to 100-fold and two homozygous lines showed a progressive ataxic phenotype between 12 and 26 weeks of age. The mice became clearly ataxic when walking and routinely fell when attempting to stand on their hind legs. Pathologic examination showed significant loss of the Purkinje cell population with Bergmann glial proliferation and shrinkage and gliosis of the molecular layer. More recently, transgenic mice have been reported with a (CAG)79 version of the SCA3 gene and also the (CAG)79 polygln tract in isolation, both under the control of the Purkinje cell specific promoter (Ikeda et al. 1996). Affected mice transgenic for the isolated polygln tract were severly ataxic, they exhibit a wide-based hind limb stance, frequently fall when moving, and are unable to rear. Overt Purkinje cell death was observed with secondary effects to the molecular and granular cell layers. No phenotype was observed in the mice transgenic for the entire mutated SCA3 gene. The authors suggested that the polygln tracts are more toxic in isolation than in the context of a protein, although in the absence of any information concerning transgene copy number, genomic structure of the integration sites, or expression levels, this interpretation should be treated with caution. These reports have shown that Purkinje cell specific overexpression of an expanded polygln tract, both in the context of the SCA1 gene or in isolation, is toxic to Purkinje cells and causes a corresponding ataxic phenotype.
