Description
Transgenic Research publishes research in transgenic and genome edited higher organisms including their production, properties resulting from the transgene or genome edit, use as experimental tools, exploitation and application, and application. The journal bridges the gap between fundamental and applied science in molecular biology and biotechnology.Coverage includes studies on transgenic and genome edited animals and plants in which insertion of transgenes, including modification of endogenous genes by any route or vehicle. Investigations into the physiology, biochemistry, molecular biology, development, genomics, genetics, behaviour and exploitation of such transgenic organisms are covered. Transgenic Research provides a valuable forum for the cross-fertilization of ideas and techniques in all areas of transgenic and genome editing technology in plants and animals.
